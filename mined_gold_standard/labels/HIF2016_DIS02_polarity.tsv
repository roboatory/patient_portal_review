Hi, Iam 34years old & my sonography says Solid cystic complex cyst noted in 6 o' clock position in retroareolar region in left breast measuring 19*18mm & left axillary lymphadenopathy.	NEUTRAL
what does it means ?	NEUTRAL
doctor advised to go for FNAC for further evaluation but i didnt get it done so far coz i'am scared with needles,	NEGATIVE
is anything serious please tell me i'am very much worried .	NEGATIVE
thanks.	NOT_LABELED
Hi, Breast cysts can be classified as either simple or complex.	NEUTRAL
Simple Cysts (fluid filled sacs) have virtually no chance of containing malignancy; they do not need to be aspirated unless they are too large and causing discomfort.	NEUTRAL
However a complex cyst is more concerning because it will on occasion be an intracystic cancer.	NEUTRAL
These type of cysts are also fluid filled sacs but contain a good percentage of solid elements, like old blood or debris.	NEUTRAL
Usually complex cysts are aspirated and the cells examined under the microscope to better evaluate their nature and to rule out cancer.	NEUTRAL
A fine needle aspiration is a simple procedure and you shouldn't be scared because the site to be biopsied will be numbed with a local anesthetic.	NEUTRAL
Please take my advice and call your Doctor to reschedule the FNA biopsy ASAP so you can have peace of mind.	NEUTRAL
Believe me, knowing what's going on is much better than not knowing and worrying about it needlessly.	NEUTRAL
Best wishes..	NOT_LABELED

If you aren't willing to follow your Doctor's advice regarding the necessary testing we cannot offer any further help or advice for you here.	NEGATIVE
Best wishes and we truly hope that your issue is not a serious one .....	POSITIVE
Hi, thanks for quick reply.... i understand what you say & will follow it.... I just want to know is it still compulsory for fnac coz now i dont have any lumps & painï¿½	POSITIVE
Unless you have had another Ultrasound test there is no way for you to know whether you have the same lump or not.	NEUTRAL
Obviously you are still not willing to do as your Doctors have advised since you seem to be coming up with any excuse not to have the recommended biopsy.	NEGATIVE
We are here to help women who are also willing to help themselves and do their part in their health care.	POSITIVE
Best wishes.	NOT_LABELED
Hi...yesterday i went for another ultrasound test & my report says : A well defined solid cystic complex lesion noted in the 6'o'clock position of left breast measuring 15*12mm.	NEUTRAL
Evidence of multiple, well defined ,anechoic cystic changes noted in left areolar regions.	NEUTRAL
Few subcentimeter lymph nodes noted in left axilla with preserved hilum,largest measuring 16*10mm.	NEUTRAL
ADVICE: FNAC for further evaluation.	NEUTRAL
Is it anything serious??	NEUTRAL
do you think FNAC is must because i dont feel any lump from outside.	NEUTRAL
if it is serious & must then i will get it done ASAP..	NOT_LABELED
Kindly suggest me.	NEUTRAL
Hi, Not all breast lumps are palpable, but they can certainly be seen when you have an Ultrasound test.	NEUTRAL
Japdip has already advised you that if your Radiologist recommended a biopsy, you should, by all means, follow his/her advice ASAP to make sure that there is nothing serious.	NEUTRAL
Believe me that you will feel much better knowing what this lump represents than not knowing.	POSITIVE
Take care..	NOT_LABELED
Thanks for your reply Zouzi...	POSITIVE
Will get FNAC soon.	NEUTRAL
I have a question how likely is it that i have breast cancer??	NEUTRAL
should i be worried??	NEUTRAL
what does my report suggest??	NEUTRAL
....i have checked with 5 doctors n out of 5 doctors 4 suggested me to go for FNAC ASAP & 1doctor told me today that I can still wait for some time....	NEGATIVE
iam really confused with my case so kindly give your opinion.	NEGATIVE
Thanks.	NOT_LABELED
Not even a Radiologist can tell you anything for sure until you have the biopsy and the cells examined by a Pathologist.	NEUTRAL
This lump could be anything and not necessarily breast cancer.	NEUTRAL
Please understand that we are not doctors and if we can't answer your questions it's because we simply don't know what else to say except to have the biopsy.	NEUTRAL
I have dense breasts (matches my head), and have had issues with my left one.	NEGATIVE
I have history of lactation with pituitary tumor but no kids (my health in general bites).	NEUTRAL
Long story short, had to have an MRI and the report says I have on the left: 7mm irregular mass with non- circumscribed edges, washout (fast uptake).	NEUTRAL
The right side has an 8mm oval circumscribed mass, washout (fast uptake) associated with a 23 mm clumped, segmental non mass enhancement.	NEUTRAL
I have to wait until October for the biopsies...	NEUTRAL
Ugh!	NOT_LABELED
Thoughts?	NOT_LABELED
Hi, I am so sorry you are going through this difficult time waiting for a biopsy,but as you well know, only a biopsy can tell for sure what is going on.	NEUTRAL
One of the problems with MRIs is that they present a lot of false positives.	NEUTRAL
Many benign lesions show up on a MRI looking quite similar to cancerous lesions therefore anything that looks suspicious, additional testing becomes necessary.	NEUTRAL
Until your lesion is checked under the microscope, there is no way to know if it is cancer.	NEUTRAL
Having ""washout kinetics"" makes it suspicious, but you could still end up with benign results.	NEUTRAL
Hang in there and we hope that your biopsy procedure will go smoothly and results in benign findings.	POSITIVE
All the best to you and good luck!	POSITIVE
Thanks...	NOT_LABELED
I am a cl in Brain/pituitary and already dealt with 5 other tumors so hoping for benign.	NEUTRAL
Will let you know..	NEUTRAL
Thanks again for the kind words.	NOT_LABELED
Right side came back as invasive grade 2.	NEUTRAL
Waiting for left side results.	NEUTRAL
Hi, I am so sorry to hear about your diagnosis.	NEGATIVE
I know finding out that we have breast cancer is scary and overwhelming but don't be discouraged.	POSITIVE
Breast cancer is a treatable disease since new technologies and many advanced treatments are available these days.	NEUTRAL
Your team of Doctors will plan treatments designed specifically for you and hopefully they will be successful in achieving complete recovery.	POSITIVE
Hoping that the biopsy done on your left breast will result in benign findings.	POSITIVE
Best wishes!.	POSITIVE
Please let us know if you need anything.	NEUTRAL
Zouzi , thank you for giving such wonderful support to rumpled and all your members on the community.	POSITIVE
Your friends at MedHelp, Cheryl.	NOT_LABELED
I am so sorry about your diagnoses.	NEGATIVE
I know how scary it is, and how alone you can feel.	NEGATIVE
Please know you are being thought of.	POSITIVE
Your doctors will come up with a great plan, and you will beat this!	POSITIVE
As I have been told more than once ""Fight Like A Girl!	POSITIVE
Hugs!!!	NOT_LABELED
Thank you Cheryl for your kind acknowledgment.	POSITIVE
It is very appreciated!	NOT_LABELED
:) I really hope ""rumpled"" will be just fine once her treatments start.	POSITIVE
The right side is er+ and pr+.	NEUTRAL
HER results pending.	NEUTRAL
Left side is invasive cancer too...	NEGATIVE
Grade 1 which is better since it sits next to my chest.	POSITIVE
On to a lot of tests to see if it is elsewhere.	NEUTRAL
Really bummed...	NEGATIVE
Hi and thank you for the update.	NOT_LABELED
It's rather unusual to have cancer in both breasts, but unfortunately it can occur and I am really sorry that this happened to you.	NEGATIVE
Even if you are one of the few women to experience cancer bilaterally, the scenario isn't as dire as it sounds.	POSITIVE
Many studies have shown that a woman's prognosis is not necessarily worse if she has breast cancer in both breasts, and that the outcomes in such cases are often excellent.	POSITIVE
Although each breast may require a different treatment strategy, the overall treatment for breast cancer in both breasts is no different than for cancer that occurs in just one breast.	NEUTRAL
The good thing is that the tumor in your right breast is rather small and is ER/PR positive which will respond well to medication, such as Tamoxifen or other similar drugs to lower considerably the risk of recurrence.	POSITIVE
The tumor in your left breast is Grade 1 which is also a good thing.	POSITIVE
It's going to be a long journey but don't be disheartened.	POSITIVE
Take one step at a time, follow your Doctor's recommendation and I am sure you'll be able to beat this disease like many of us did.	POSITIVE
Wishing you all the best and successful outcome.	POSITIVE
Thanks.	NOT_LABELED
Will keep you posted on the other tests...	NEUTRAL
I have a known lung mass, but benign it is thought.	NEUTRAL
Joyï¿½	NEUTRAL
More testing...	NEGATIVE
More waiting.	NEGATIVE
The left side is different being er+,pr- and her-.	NEUTRAL
The right is er+. pr+, her-.	NEUTRAL
I still will get the meds just thought it was strange.	NEUTRAL
So I spent the day making a bunch of pre-op clearance appointments and the gene doc (which will be after).	NEUTRAL
I am opting for the double mastectomy.	NEUTRAL
I could have done the lumpectomy but with my history and the placement of the tumors, I would have been very lopsided so the double is a better choice and I may avoid radiation which can also be a better choice (I need it elsewhere and trying to avoid as much as I can).	NEUTRAL
They are sing if I can get a ct and bone scan before surgery as well.	NEUTRAL
Hi, ER (Estrogen) and PR (Progesterone) receptor status tests are done to show whether or not one or both of those hormones fuel your tumor.	NEUTRAL
Estrogen positive, even if it's weak, medication such as Tamoxifen (or other similar drugs) is usually recommended to lower the risk of recurrence in the same breast and helps prevent new cancer in the opposite breast.	NEUTRAL
Cancer that is hormone-sensitive is slightly slower growing and has a better chance of responding to hormone-suppression drugs, than cancer that is hormone receptor negative.	NEUTRAL
HER-2/neu negative cancer is also a good thing, because it is considered less aggressive than HER-2 positive.	POSITIVE
I am sure that your Doctors will explain all this to you in details, when you'll meet them.	NEUTRAL
Since you have decided on a double mastectomy, I will send you a link by PM.	NEUTRAL
Wishing you all the best and I hope that everything goes smoothly for you.	POSITIVE
Take care..	NOT_LABELED
i am sorry to hear about your diagnoses.	NEGATIVE
I was diagnosed just a little short of a year ago, and I too opted for a double mastectomy.	NEUTRAL
Please let me know if I can lend any support, or any answer any questions.	NEUTRAL
Thanks!	NOT_LABELED
Hi, I imagine you are busy, and at least a bit overwhelmed, with all the tests, appointments, etc., in preparation for your surgery.	NEUTRAL
Here is a link to an old thread that has been helpful to many members and may provide a few useful tips for you as well: Wishing you all the best, bluebutterfly.	NEUTRAL
You are more then welcome.	POSITIVE
I know it seems so overwhelming, but you will get through this, I promise.	POSITIVE
Again, please, feel free to ask anything about my journey.	NEUTRAL
I finally got a surgical date: 12/16.	NEUTRAL
If all goes well I will have a diep, but not sure as I have had so many abdominal surgeries.	NEUTRAL
May be a tug (thigh).	NEUTRAL
Thanks for the tips!	NOT_LABELED
Hi, Excellent decision!	POSITIVE
Please make sure (As suggested by Sue Young in the PM I sent you) that this is a specialized surgery and should be performed by experienced plastic surgeons who have done numerous Diep Reconstruction Surgeries.	NEUTRAL
I hope all goes well for you and I am sure everything will.	POSITIVE
Best of luck to you!! :)	POSITIVE
I am glad you have a surgery date.	POSITIVE
I didn't have that option, but have seen great results from it.	POSITIVE
One day and step at a time.	POSITIVE
I know how it feels like a lifetime until surgery.	NEGATIVE
If you need support, leading up to, and after surgery please know we are here for you.	POSITIVE
Waiting is the worst...	NEGATIVE
The surgeons (three of them) are skilled in minor surgery and have done many diep and tram surgeries so I feel I am in good hands.	POSITIVE
I am trying to prepare ahead of time, but still feeling stressed.	NEGATIVE
Yes I knowï¿½the waiting is very stressful, but try not to get discouraged!	POSITIVE
Please remember that ""Positive thinking leads to positive outcomes"" The important thing here is that you have found Doctors who are very experienced with this type of surgery, and especially knowing that you are in good hands.	POSITIVE
I am sure you'll be just fine and these difficult times will be over sooner than you think!	POSITIVE
I wish you well! God Bless!	POSITIVE
Hello!	NOT_LABELED
Just an update.	NOT_LABELED
Doing my pre-op appointments.	NEUTRAL
For sure I am getting the DIEP which is nice.	POSITIVE
There was a question because I had so many surgeries.	NEUTRAL
My lung function has improved so that should not be an issue.	POSITIVE
I only have my blood tests to go but given that I have those all the time, I don't have an fear that those will have an issue.	POSITIVE
My ekg was fine (except for the lady ripping off the stickers and leaving me bruises, why won't they listen!!!	POSITIVE
I am even more nervous as the day gets closer about how to manage post op, and just hoping I won't need chemo.	NEGATIVE
I know these are small, but every surgery so far things have turned out to be different (i.e. Larger) than imaging showed so just hope this history does not continue.	NEGATIVE
I have no idea as well how I am going to manage my one cat who is very attached to me...	NEUTRAL
He is going to be a mess with a restriction of not being able to be with me during the day and will body slam the door.	NEGATIVE
I am hoping I can keep him calm somehow!	NEUTRAL
Hi there, Thank you for the update and I am glad to know that all the tests you have had so far, are fine and that you'll have DIEP breast reconstruction.	POSITIVE
Excellent choice!	NOT_LABELED
It's understandable that you are feeling nervous right now!but as soon as things get rolling, all will go well and you'll feel much better.	POSITIVE
I also hope you won't need chemo!we know it's not easy to go through this therapy, but if Oncologists recommended it, it's very important to follow their advice because it does save lives.	POSITIVE
I hope you have read Sue Young's info about post-op care that I sent you a few weeks ago (Link below) When you are well prepared and know what to expect, I am sure your recovery will be quicker than you think.	POSITIVE
I'll be thinking and praying for you on the 14th and hoping that all goes well for you.	POSITIVE
Best wishes and GOOD LUCK!!	POSITIVE
:)	NOT_LABELED
Yes I read everything and have prepared, I hope, well ahead of time.	POSITIVE
Thanks!	NOT_LABELED
I am so sorry to hear about your diagnosis.	NEGATIVE
Thinking of you as you prepare for your surgery...	NEUTRAL
At least you have a good idea of what to expect, after reading Sue Young'sexcellent post about preparing for bilateral mastectomy (the link for which I providedin my 10/17/15 comment, above).	POSITIVE
I certainly understand your nervousness; it's a lot to deal with, right down to ""pet parent"" concerns.	NEUTRAL
(Do you have someone who can help ""babysit"" your one cat, to try to keep him calm until things are back to normal?)	NEUTRAL
I'm glad to hear you will be able to have the DIEP reconstruction!	POSITIVE
Know that many thoughts and prayers will be with you.	NEUTRAL
Hugs, bluebutterfly.	NOT_LABELED
I wish we did have a cat sitter but alas he has had a lot of urinary issues and my only option would be to put him down as he is not a cat I can foster out due to his special needs.	NEGATIVE
His sister is calm.	POSITIVE
I did get come essential oils and put them around and he was calm for a day...	POSITIVE
Today he is picking up on my nerves and is a whiny mess...	NEGATIVE
:/ I am just hoping we can work around him.	NEUTRAL
Hi again, Actually, I meant would someone be staying with you at first who might be able to calm him at least a little when he wants to be in your room and can't be.	NEUTRAL
Was it your doctor who said he can't be with you?	NEUTRAL
For how long?	NOT_LABELED
By the way, by my comments I don't mean to suggest you haven't already thought of every possible thing, esp.knowing your pet so well.	NEUTRAL
I just hate to think of your having to worry a lot about him at the same time you are going through everything .	NEGATIVE
:-( I know a bit about the additional stress pet concerns can cause, because at one point when my husband was vey sick, I had to put our dog  in our Vet's hospital for a while.	NEGATIVE
They had wire cages with a tray a few inches below to catch everything when no one was there to take him out as often as usual.	NEGATIVE
He was old and had never been away from us, so we were worried about him, but they said he adjusted okay, and he didn't seem traumatized when he came home.	NEUTRAL
I'll be thinking of you next week.	NEUTRAL
Please let us know how you're doing once you're feeling well enough.	NEUTRAL
bb.	NOT_LABELED
I am popping in today.	NEUTRAL
I am thankfully Stage I. I get my oncotyping on Friday.	POSITIVE
I am having tons of post op complications like an infected drain, so that was popped out, then I got an abscess, another drain put in and I got cellulitis on the other side.	NEGATIVE
My belly was rock hard and bright red.	NEGATIVE
It is still part hard and red still.	NEGATIVE
The up and down fevers are driving me nuts.	NEGATIVE
I am hot, cold, hot, cold.	NEUTRAL
The cat was for the most part good.	POSITIVE
He was calm when I came home and while he wanted to be with me, he was patient to a point..	POSITIVE
by the time he did jump up on me, I was ready, although he did get me once when I was sleeping.	NEUTRAL
Once he got the hang of it though, it has been good.	POSITIVE
Hi and thank you for the update.	NOT_LABELED
I've been thinking of you often and wondered how you were doing.	NEUTRAL
I am happy that your tumor is stage one, but sorry to know that you experienced a few complication after your surgery.	NEUTRAL
I hope that you are doing better now and hopefully medication will take care of the infection and fever soon.	NEUTRAL
I also hope that your Oncotype test will be low ( 18 or less) indicating that there is a much lower chance that the breast cancer will return and most probably chemotherapy won't be necessary.	POSITIVE
P.S. Your cat seemed to discern that you were not feeling your best and he is indeed a very good pet!	POSITIVE
:)	NOT_LABELED
Hi I just did a follow up ultra sound, on a lump that my radiologist had been following for a year and a half.	NEUTRAL
My results said that it grew and changed from 5mm to 9mm diagnoses bi raids 4 so i had the biopsy doctor calls and said that tissues are benign.	NEUTRAL
Then he proceeds to tell me that i have a intraductal papilloma 9mm.	NEUTRAL
he then stated that i need and excisional biopsy time to see a breast surgent, during the conversation he stated that it is very rare that these are cancer only a 5% chance.	NEUTRAL
So my questions is can i leave this alone i prefer to just follow it?	NEUTRAL
If i left it in and it did turn to cancer what could the outcome be how dangerous could it get even if i am being followed.	NEUTRAL
I again would prefer to just leave it alone.	NEUTRAL
Thank you.	NOT_LABELED
I would NOT just leave it alone and I can't imagine why anyone would choose to do this.	NEGATIVE
5% may not seem much of a chance to you but even a 1% chance would send me to a Breast Surgeon immediately.	NEUTRAL
You can do whatever you feel comfortable with but since there has been growth give it some more thought before you decide to ignore this condition.	NEGATIVE
Even if you do see a Breast Surgeon there is a chance that he/she may agree with waiting and doing close interval testing and the choice will still be yours and yours alone.	NEUTRAL
Please at least see the Surgeon, OK ??	NOT_LABELED
Regards .....	NOT_LABELED
Hi thank you for your feed back.	POSITIVE
I am seeing a breast sergeant on Thursday DEC 3ird.	NEUTRAL
I have also schedule a appointment for a second opinion in January of 2016.	NEUTRAL
Please know that i am concerned and do not take this lightly, but for me i have had so many scares and they have thank goodness all come back benign.	POSITIVE
It is scary but for me i feel maybe it would just be better to follow this and see if there is a change.	NEGATIVE
I will post more on Thursday when i have the results.	NOT_LABELED
Regards.....	NOT_LABELED
Great to hear that you are going to keep seeking a definite answer.	POSITIVE
I'm all for second opinions and I believe that a person should keep seeking information until they are comfortable with all the answers.	NEUTRAL
When I hear ""don't worry about it"" I always want to know ""WHY"" I shouldn't worry :) Always appreciate follow-ups .... Thanks.	NEUTRAL
I think you made the right choice, for sure!	POSITIVE
Better safe then sorry!	POSITIVE
Thinking of you!	NOT_LABELED
I was initially diagnosed with intraductal papilloma (after a biopsy came back negative for cancer).	NEUTRAL
I had this removed.	NEUTRAL
My pathology results came back with DCIS.	NEUTRAL
I've since had a recurrence.	NEUTRAL
There is some debate about whether mammograms and surgery actually spread the disease.	NEUTRAL
Cancer if left untreated can be extremely dangerous and even fatal.	NEGATIVE
I don't necessarily think that conventional medicine has all the answers.	NEGATIVE
Some people have had really amazing results with lifestyle medicine.	POSITIVE
You need to do what feels right to you.	NEUTRAL
Intuition is a valuable tool.	NEUTRAL
Good luck with whatever you decide.	POSITIVE
Thank you!	NOT_LABELED
Hi Thank you for all your feed back, I spoke with the breast Sergent on Thursday and asked a lot questions.	NEUTRAL
The doctor i thought was so supportive she answered all my questions and then some.	POSITIVE
When asked she told me she has recently had a patient whose papilloma results cancer.	NEUTRAL
According to the new statistics 20 to 30%chance intraductal papilloma being cancer.	NEUTRAL
numbers increased great, I still have a second opinion in January, Do to the biopsy i have a 3cm hematoma and i am very bruised the radiologist change his plan and did a vacuum core biopsy instead of just a core biopsy, which is fine.	NEUTRAL
The doctor told me if i choose to do the extensional she would have to wait for the hematoma to dissipate as they would not be able to get to the area.	NEUTRAL
And if i choose to be followed she would follow me every three months twice and then move to 6 months, I left telling her i would be in touch.	NEUTRAL
I am confused now but i will wait for my second opinion appointment do research shop for the holidays and pray that i make the right decision in the end.	NEGATIVE
Scared!!!	NEGATIVE
It sounds as though you have found a GREAT Surgeon who has exactly the right information and caring that you need.	POSITIVE
The follow-up plan seems very appropriate and I would be comfortable with that myself.	POSITIVE
I do think it wise to go ahead with the second opinion to further clear things in your mind.	POSITIVE
The hematoma issue isn't at all unusual in such circumstances with biopsies but it can complicate the situation.	NEUTRAL
Remember that the decision you make today or 3 months from now won't necessarily change the outcome.	NEUTRAL
Even though papilloma can be cancer, if there is only one they are usually watched for a period of time.	NEUTRAL
You're on the right track but try not to confuse yourself by doing TOO much research as no 2 cases are the same and you can't depend too much on percentages, they are too general.	NEUTRAL
Take care and stay busy .... NO negative thinking !!	NEUTRAL
Hi I went for my second opinion, Not sure what to make of the appointment though.	NEUTRAL
This doctor is a top breast Sergent in my area, She actually did my first breast surgery in 2008.	POSITIVE
When i saw her i felt like she was a little pushy, She said to me it grew and surgery was the best route even though i do not have any of the symptoms and the biopsy came back benign.	NEUTRAL
She quoted to me (Pathology report too consider excision).	NEUTRAL
When i ask questions i felt like she thought i was stupid and she did not want to answer questions she cut me off, proceeded to tell me two options surgery or follow every six months.	NEGATIVE
My question which i think is important does anyone know?	NEUTRAL
Are there any studies of women who were follow with intraductal papilloma what is the long term out come.	NEUTRAL
That's too bad that you had a less than comfortable experience with the Breast Surgeon; perhaps she was having a bad day ????	NEGATIVE
At this point since the chance of a single papilloma being malignant is rather small you might as well follow it for the recommended 6 months.	NEUTRAL
This all began the last of November and you should count the 6 months from that date and see what is recommended at your next check-up which would be in the Spring.	NEUTRAL
If at that time it is determined to be benign then it can be left alone.	NEUTRAL
On the other hand if you are ""done"" with all the re-checks and possible biopsies then have it removed and over with.	NEUTRAL
It all comes down to what you are comfortable with.	NEUTRAL
I would make my appointment now for the 6 month check-up if that's the way you intend to go so there will be no waiting when the time actually arrives.	NEUTRAL
Regards ....	NOT_LABELED
Hi doctor is going to do a lumpectomy on the 23ird of February.	NEUTRAL
I did a lot of hard thinking research and reading decided it is too much stress, and i ask my self would i have any regrets with my decision if it changed.	NEUTRAL
Surgery is better way to go.	POSITIVE
My radiologist stated excision but my doctor is doing a wired lumpectomy is this normal procedure and what is the difference between the 2 surgery's I have done a little reading but still a little confused.	NEUTRAL
I am nerves about the surgery but more then anything I have a fear of being put to sleep!	NEGATIVE
I know I will be fine but still a little scary.	NEGATIVE
Thank you!	NOT_LABELED
I really don't see any difference in the two.	NEUTRAL
The area is being removed either way.	NEUTRAL
It seems to me that this is just the use of different terminology.	NEUTRAL
Best wishes for a speedy recovery .....	POSITIVE
Sending healing thoughts your way.	POSITIVE
Having it removed will give you peace of mind.	POSITIVE
Please let us know how you're doing.	NOT_LABELED
Hi so the surgery went well The doctor got everything.	POSITIVE
Now three days later getting back to my self pain is not to bad,  I have been taking Tylenol.	POSITIVE
Still waiting on the results.	NEUTRAL
Do i really have to wait three weeks before i can get fully back into normal daily activity's?	NEUTRAL
That does seem rather a long time but it depends upon exactly what your normal activity consists of, like strenuous exercise which would not be wise or several other things that would put undue strain on muscles, etc.	NEUTRAL
I would increase your activities very gradually but NEVER go against the advice of the Surgeon.	NEUTRAL
Complete healing of the tissues does take quite some time and you certainly would not want to delay that.	NEUTRAL
I'm glad to hear the things went well and hope for GREAT news when the reports come in.	POSITIVE
Do take it easy though.... Regards.	NEUTRAL
When I went in for my mammogram, I was told that my benign scattered calcifications that I had for the last 2 years were misread and are actually fine, linear calcifications, but because they were stable for 2 years they told me to come back in 6 months.	NEUTRAL
They gave me a BI RADS 3.	NEUTRAL
When I got my report, my breast density was reported as extremely dense.	NEUTRAL
I have always had heterogeneously dense breasts.	NEUTRAL
I have since done a lot of googling and cannot understand why they wouldn't biopsy.	NEGATIVE
I have found out that DCIS can be stable for a while and that the morphology is more important than the stability over time.	NEUTRAL
Why would they wait!	NEGATIVE
I am so scared!	NEGATIVE
Do they know what they are doing?	NEGATIVE
Thoughts please?	NOT_LABELED
Hi.Experienced Radiologists are quite able to identify typically benign breast calcifications depending on their form and pattern.	NEUTRAL
If no suspicion is detected a biopsy is not required to prevent unnecessary procedures.	NEUTRAL
BIRADS Category 3, means that the findings have a very high probability of being benign, therefore recommending a short-interval follow-up.	NEUTRAL
I wouldn't worry so much if I were you, because what your radiologist has recommended is standard procedure.	NEUTRAL
If these calcification were suspicious in any way, I am sure a biopsy would have certainly been ordered.	NEUTRAL
But of course this is up to you to decide!.	NEUTRAL
if you still feel uncomfortable waiting six months for a follow up, you could always have your films read by another Radiologist for a second opinion, or ask your Doctor to order a biopsy.	NEUTRAL
Best wishes...	NOT_LABELED
Thank you for your answer.	NEUTRAL
I don't understand why I have to have a mammogram in 6 months.	NEGATIVE
Why can't I just get one in 1 year?	NEUTRAL
I don't think BI RADS 3 is very useful to have to spend the extra money to watch something that is benign.	NEGATIVE
When will I ever go back to once a year mammograms?	NEUTRAL
Hi again, You have been asked to have these calcification monitored every 6 month simply because when the radiologist assigns calcifications to a ""probably benign"" category, the risk of malignancy even if very low ( less than 2%) can change unexpectedly.	NEUTRAL
Typically these calcifications will be monitored every six months for at least one year.	NEUTRAL
Assuming that no new changes are found, your doctor will recommend you have a routine mammogram once a year.	NEUTRAL
I hope that you'll follow your doctor's recommendation to make sure there is no change in the size, shape or number of calcifications.	NEUTRAL
Take care..	NOT_LABELED
My calcifications have already been stable for over 2 years.	POSITIVE
Can you show me any resource that says if a radiologist sees fine, linear calcifications to ""wait and see"" for six months?	NEUTRAL
If they want them stable for a year, I have been stable for more than 2 years.	POSITIVE
I have not seen 1 resource where it is recommended that fine, linear calcifications be put in the BI RADS 3 or 2 categories.	NEUTRAL
My mammograms have all been the same, the only difference is that the radiologists have misread them.	NEGATIVE
Thank you.	NOT_LABELED
If the calcifications can change unexpectedly, then is the risk still less than 2%?	NEUTRAL
If they haven't changed in 2 years, what is the risk they will change in 2 1/2 years, 3 years, ect...	NEUTRAL
I really cannot say why your Radiologist asked you to follow-up in 6 months since your calcifications have been stable for 2 years.	NEUTRAL
Linear calcification is not always indicative of malignancy.	NEUTRAL
The suspicion is raised only when they are clustered and appear to form several branches.	NEUTRAL
When they are linear but detached, such as probably yours are, it's usually not worrisome but they have to be monitored regularly.	NEUTRAL
I wish I could give you more information about the things you are requesting here, but the only advice I can give you is to have your Mammogram films read by a different Radiologist for a second opinion and also to have your test report explained to you in details by your Doctor who is your best source of information.	NEUTRAL
I wish you well...	NOT_LABELED
Thank you zouzi for the information.	NOT_LABELED
I don't understand if they are not worrisome, why watch them?	NEUTRAL
It seems like a waste of resources.	NEGATIVE
What benign condition is linear but detached calcifications?	NEUTRAL
You are welcome.	NOT_LABELED
I don't know what else to tell you ..	NOT_LABELED
I don't know what else to tell you .. except that monitoring closely ""probably benign"" calcification is standard procedure and in my opinion it's not a waste of resources if we want to make sure that our breasts are healthy and stay healthy.	NEUTRAL
If you are terribly worried about these calcifications, please take my advice and seek a second opinion from a different radiologist who might recommend a biopsy (if necessary) so you can have peace of mind.	NEUTRAL
It appears from the many posts on this forum regarding incisions opening after lumpectomies that it must be pretty common.	NEUTRAL
I had a lumpectomy on March 12.	NEUTRAL
Two weeks later, it opened overnight.	NEGATIVE
In the morn it was oozing & bleeding.	NEGATIVE
I returned to the surgeon, who said it was infected.	NEGATIVE
I was given antibiotics.	NEUTRAL
My oncologist looked at it a week later and said it was no longer infected, but to return to the surgeon if it looked like it wasn't healing.	NEUTRAL
Part of the incision is slowly healing, but a new section opened and is bleeding slightly.	NEUTRAL
I keep it covered with gauze to keep it clean.	NEUTRAL
How long shoud I give this to heal?	NEUTRAL
I had an infection post surgery and it took four weeks to heal completely.	NEGATIVE
My wound was deep and had to be packed.	NEUTRAL
Wounds heal from the bottom up.	NEUTRAL
Healing seemed to be very slow but then it just went.	NEUTRAL
Actually it was a bit longer.	NEUTRAL
My incision burst on the 24th December (following surgery on the 19th Dec) and it was fully healed by the 5th Feb.	NEUTRAL
I hope yours is OK and that everything goes well for you.	NEUTRAL
Just be patient.	NEUTRAL
Time frames are different for everyone.	NEUTRAL
If you have any concerns make sure you get them checked out.	NEUTRAL
J.	NOT_LABELED
Thanks.	NOT_LABELED
I didn't expect this to happen at all with the healing of the incision.	NEUTRAL
My surgeon did not seem concerned.	POSITIVE
He surely sees it all the time.	NEUTRAL
It's good to be reassured.	POSITIVE
I am so glad to have this site with all who care so much about one another.	POSITIVE
So it's been about a month or so since the wound opened.	NEUTRAL
That part seems to be healing.	POSITIVE
There is another section that after all this time, that decided to open the other day.	NEGATIVE
It's small and bleeding just a little.	NEUTRAL
I'll give it some more time.	NEUTRAL
Thank you again and I hope everything is ok with you now.	POSITIVE
I didn't either.	NOT_LABELED
Personally I didn't expect to get an infection and definitely didn't anticipate needing district nursing input.	NEGATIVE
Perhaps I took recovery for granted as I healed really well, and quickly, after having a duct out during a previous operation.	NEUTRAL
It is good if a surgeon doesn't seem concerned -I think.	POSITIVE
Bleeding is a good sign as it denotes healthy tissue.	POSITIVE
Too much bleeding is not though.	NEGATIVE
I've really benefited from this site and the support, advice and information too.	POSITIVE
It's been invaluable.	POSITIVE
I expect that section too will heal.	POSITIVE
I think it's normal for us to become anxious, etc during our recoveries.	NEUTRAL
This is all new to us and we're learning about ourselves and our bodies during this process.	NEUTRAL
I had stitches poke through my skin too.	NEUTRAL
Just when I thought I'd healed I found this thing on my breast.	NEUTRAL
I was scared it had become infected again but it was only a mushy little stitch which I pulled out myself.	NEUTRAL
(The stitch was redundant anyhow as the surgical registrar had cut it to insert a drain for the infection).	NEUTRAL
You're welcome.	NOT_LABELED
I'm fine.	POSITIVE
I've just finished radiation treatment and are getting over residual fatigue.	NEGATIVE
Just be vigilant about your breast (without making it worse) and discuss any concerns you have with your doctor.	NEUTRAL
J.	NOT_LABELED
A related discussion,  was started.	NOT_LABELED
Hello.	NOT_LABELED
I am having the same problem.	NEUTRAL
My wound is still open after 5 weeks.	NEUTRAL
I have to and see surgeon on Monday and likely have it packed and changed daily she said.	NEUTRAL
This *****!!!	NOT_LABELED
My radiation has been delayed by several weeks they said until healed.	NEGATIVE
My question is, does it hurt to have packing.	NEUTRAL
I have never had it before and am a little overwhelmed.	NEGATIVE
This is a very old thread.	NEUTRAL
I would suggest you start your own new thread.	NEUTRAL
If you describe the details of your situation and ask your questions there, you will be more likely to get answers addressed specifically to you and your concerns.	NEUTRAL
Best wishes.	NOT_LABELED
Radiation does delay healing so that's why you are being delayed for that part of your treatment.	NEUTRAL
As far as the packing is concerned, if the area isn't painful at the present then I doubt that it will be terribly uncomfortable.	POSITIVE
I have had a couple of areas that required packing and I had no pain but it was not in the same area as yours.	NEUTRAL
The amount of discomfort with the packing and removing it daily would also depend on the depth of the wound.	NEUTRAL
Here's hoping it will be effective and not cause you very much discomfort.	NEUTRAL
Hang in there, these things do happen now and then but they can be overcome with a little extra time.	NEUTRAL
Kindest regards ....	NOT_LABELED
I had a 3D mammo because of a large mass in my right breast.	NEUTRAL
I was told a 3D is much more accurate than a standard mammo.	POSITIVE
Nobody would tell me the result of this but now they say I need an ultrasound.	NEUTRAL
If the 3D is so accurate why would they need an ultrasound?	NEUTRAL
That means cancer,right?	NEGATIVE
Nobody willtellme anything and I amso scared.	NEGATIVE
I am so sorry you aren't getting clear answers.	NEGATIVE
My doctor pretty much told me from me 2nd mammo (6 month follow up) and u/s that they believed I had cancer.	NEUTRAL
And another told me the same thing before my biopsy.	NEUTRAL
I believe there is a truth in the saying ""No news is good news"".	NEUTRAL
I know it's hard, and nerve wracking, and Damn Scary!	NEGATIVE
But, you can handle this!	POSITIVE
Maybe take a family member or friend with you to your appts to take notes.	NEUTRAL
That's what I did.	NEUTRAL
And seriously, I would read the notes taken the next day and not remember 3/4 of what was written, or I would remember things completely different then what was actually said.	NEUTRAL
Your head is spinning...	NEGATIVE
you are scared!	NEGATIVE
I hope you get answers soon!!!	NEUTRAL
Hang in there!	POSITIVE
I believe I addressed your concerns in my response to your post of July 14th.	NEUTRAL
At that time I mentioned that Mammogram and Ultrasound were sometimes necessary to determine the nature of any finding in the breast.	NEUTRAL
You need to speak to your Dr. for answers regarding your concerns and I believe I advised this also in my previous response.	NEUTRAL
You evidently have been told quite a lot here as well as from your Dr. and the Radiologist that read your films.	NEUTRAL
Please speak to the Dr.,or his/her Nurse who ordered your tests.	NEUTRAL
They have all your information and know the answers and will be more than happy to explain things to you.	NEUTRAL
As I stated before Cancer cannot be determined until a biopsy is done so be patient and take things one step at a time and ASK questions of the Professionals who are treating you.	NEUTRAL
Kindest regards ....	NOT_LABELED
I am terrified and confused and cannot remember the many,many things I have been told in the last few days and that includes posts here.	NEGATIVE
But you are wrong -- no one has been ""more than happy"" to explain things.	NEGATIVE
The medical professionals have not been forthcoming, they have been elusive and reluctant which leads me to believe they are hiding something very bad.	NEGATIVE
I'm sorry but there is no way that we or your Dr.s can make you remember what you have been told about these circumstances.	NEUTRAL
Perhaps you could ask you family Dr. for some type of medication that would help in calming these fears that you seem to have about cancer.	NEUTRAL
I will try one more time to assure you that the Dr.s certainly are NOT trying to hide anything from you ...	NEUTRAL
why in world would they do that ??	NEUTRAL
For the third time I will say that there are no answers until all your tests have been completed and only a biopsy can diagnose cancer .... not size nor how something looks on film.	NEUTRAL
It also might help if you would call your Dr..s office and ask for a copy of the reports on the tests that have been done so far.	NEUTRAL
At the bottom of the page there is always an ""opinion"" as well as some recommendation as to what should be done next.	NEUTRAL
I would also like to ask if in the future you have more questions, you would add them to the same post so that all your information is together.	NEUTRAL
It makes it much easier for us to get the compete picture and would even be a help to you to be able to read what you have ask as well as our answers since you say you have trouble remembering what you're being told.	NEUTRAL
Call you Dr. .... ask the Nurse ...	NEUTRAL
read the reports or better yet have them read and explained to you but don't expect answers before there are answers.	NEUTRAL
Every test that is done has a different purpose and they are always used in combination to get an accurate conclusion.	NEUTRAL
Regards .....	NOT_LABELED
I am so sorry you aren't getting clear answers.	NEGATIVE

Checking to see if you have had your ultrasound yet??	NEUTRAL
After a clear mammogram and ultrasound, I was sent for an Mri because of family history.	NEUTRAL
A suspicious 1cm mass popped and now I need a biopsy.	NEGATIVE
Should I be terrified?	NEGATIVE
Too lateï¿½I am..help.	NEGATIVE
This discussion is related to.	NEUTRAL
I see no reason to panic at this point.	NEUTRAL
MRI is a much more sensitive type of test and can often show things that other tests do not.	NEUTRAL
A biopsy of course is the only sure way to diagnose what this mass represents.	NEUTRAL
It could be a Fibroadenoma which is a benign breast tumor.	NEUTRAL
I would be surprised that a mass of this size representing cancer would not have shown up on either the Mammogram or Ultrasound.	NEUTRAL
Proceed with the recommended biopsy which will define more accurately what you're dealing with.	NEUTRAL
Being terrified never helps and usually tends to cloud your vision as well as your thoughts.	NEGATIVE
I imagine that you are seeing a Breast Specialist but if not this is something that you need to arrange.	NEUTRAL
Family history accounts for a very small percentage of diagnosed cases of Breast Cancer even though it is a risk factor.	NEUTRAL
Regards .....	NOT_LABELED
Thanks so much for helping me down off of the ledge.	POSITIVE
It has become all consuming.	NEUTRAL
Biopsy is on Thursday.	NEUTRAL
Wish me luck!	POSITIVE
You're more than welcome .... it's scary up there on the ledge :) Luck, Wishes and Prayers are with you from all of us here.	POSITIVE
We know how it is but whatever it is we always seem to be able to handle it.	POSITIVE
Let us know when you get your results.... Regards.	NEUTRAL
It has Been a while since I have logged on.	NEUTRAL
The mass was triple negative cancer.	POSITIVE
I had a lumpectomy lAst week.	NEUTRAL
It was a 1 cm mass with clear margins and no nodes involved..	NEUTRAL
Thank God !	POSITIVE
Still need chemo though.ugh!	NEGATIVE
Meeting with the oncologist next week.	NEUTRAL
I was not so afraid of the surgery, it is the thought of chemo that is flipping me out!	NEGATIVE
Any thoughts or words of advice?	NEUTRAL
Thanks for the update .... sounds as though you have done well so far and it's a GREAT thing that nodes were not involved.	POSITIVE
As far as the Chemo goes, it's hard to say.	NEUTRAL
Everyone and their response to the drugs is so varied you'll just have to wait and see .... great advice, right ??	NEUTRAL
Seriously, some women can breeze through it with little or no problem and others have adverse reactions.	NEUTRAL
Keep positive thoughts and don't go looking for ""what might occur"" and don't hesitate to make clear any problems you may have.	NEUTRAL
The Oncology team will have many things that will help with or counteract any side effects that you experience.	POSITIVE
Don't keep it to yourself; make it known if you have a problem of any kind.	NEUTRAL
Wishing you a good experience during your treatment .... you can do it, I know you can !!	POSITIVE
Take care and keep us posted when you have the time.	NEUTRAL
Kindest regards ....	NOT_LABELED
Trying g to keep positive, but it is quite hard at times.	NEUTRAL
Do you think I'll be needing a petscan before chemo?	NEUTRAL
Breast doc says no.	NEUTRAL
We will see what the oncologist says.	NEUTRAL
I am really not up for any more scans at this point.	NEGATIVE
Just want to deal with the matter at hand and get it over with.	NEUTRAL
Maybe and maybe not ..... Oncologists all have their routine before, during and after treatment so it's really up to him/her.	NEUTRAL
Considering all the other issues one more scan would be far down on the worry list.	NEUTRAL
I'm sure you will be having them after treatment and perhaps routinely for a period of time.	NEUTRAL
Usually there are yearly check-ups with Onc. or possibly 6 months at first when you have finished treatment.	NEUTRAL
Some Oncologists see patients for a couple of years and some will see the patient as long as the patient wishes.	NEUTRAL
It's a very individual thing with the Oncologists.	NEUTRAL
Just hang in there; you know it won't be over in a moment .... all things take time and we all have a problem being patient when it comes to WAITING.	NEUTRAL
Do you best, you've done a SUPER job so far; don't spoil your record .... Take care now.	POSITIVE
Thanks for the kind words.	POSITIVE
Is 3 weeks post op a long time before seeing the oncologist?	NEUTRAL
I'm hearing no because you need time to heal.	NEUTRAL
WAiting and being anxious really *****!	NEGATIVE
No, not at all .... healing is a complicated process in the tissues below the surface.	NEUTRAL
There will seem to be no end to the ""waiting"" but it's all a learning experience.	NEUTRAL
After all is said and done you will be a much more patient person ..... hopefully :) .	POSITIVE
take care .....	NOT_LABELED
Hi everyone, I'm so anxious at the moment.	NEGATIVE
I'm having nightmares and not sleeping well.	NEGATIVE
I had an ultrasound which showed: 7x3x7 mm breast lesion 2cm from nipple.	NEUTRAL
Hypoechoic with some through transmission.	NEUTRAL
Small echogenic foci are identified within.	NEUTRAL
No vasculariry or architectural distortion.	NEUTRAL
It may represent a fibroadenoma however there does appear to be some tapering suggesting ductal in origin.	NEUTRAL
How likely is this to be cancer?	NEUTRAL
I'm seeing specialist on tuedsay.	NEUTRAL
The report says it suggest a a biopsy.	NEUTRAL
I have a 2 year old son and I breast fed him for 1.5 years.	NEUTRAL
I thought this would have been protective.	NEUTRAL
I'm really after some support and some insight as to how likely this is something nasty.I actually went in to see my doctor as I had other lumps which just turned out to be benign glandular tissue- just part of my breast anatomy and then they found this unexpected lesion :-( Joanne.	NEGATIVE
Hi, Please try not to panic!	NEUTRAL
Most breast lesions are not cancerous.	POSITIVE
A variety of benign breast lumps like fibroadenoma or cysts do appear suspicious on x-rays sometimes,but it's nothing more than that.	POSITIVE
The fact that the report states that no vasculariry (blood flow)or architectural distortion is present,it's a good sign!	POSITIVE
Most biopsy are recommended just to make sure and it's an excellent medical procedure to obtain a correct diagnosis!	POSITIVE
Try not to worry....Hopefully this is nothing to be concerned about.	NEUTRAL
Wishing you all the best!	POSITIVE
Thanks zouzi.	NOT_LABELED
I don't think it's a cyst because it's not clear, has calcifications in it :/ that's what the radiologist said to me.	NEGATIVE
And it has some tapering so not a nice well circumcised lesion, all risk factors for malignancy from what I have read.	NEGATIVE
I feel too young to have cancer.	NEUTRAL
But then I've read that it can happen any age.	NEUTRAL
You are welcome Joanne, I don't think it's a cyst either,I just mentioned that some cysts could also look suspicious	NEUTRAL
What you have is most probably a Fibroadenoma which is a solid lump that needs to be biopsied to make sure that in fact it is a benign lesion,which could also present with calcification and not well circumcised .	NEUTRAL
Many breast lumps that need to be investigated are not necessarily malignant but the only way to make sure is to have a biopsy.	NEUTRAL
Hoping that all turns out fine for you!	POSITIVE
:)  .	NOT_LABELED
There's just so many stories of young women who are fighting this that I've read about in the last week on the internet.	NEUTRAL
It's make things seem more probable.	NEGATIVE
Whatever the result, this experience has made me realise that I need to change the way I live And live a bit more for today.	POSITIVE
I have never felt so anxious or scared in my life.	NEGATIVE
I'll never take my life for granted again.	NEUTRAL
I'm amazed at how muh this has changed me.	NEUTRAL
Yes,I know that the possibility of ""breast cancer"" can cause a lot of stress and anxiety,but remember that reading stories over the internet about women with BC is not necessarily related to your situation at all,since you haven't been diagnosed with anything yet.	NEUTRAL
Try your best to stay calm and don't let your mind be filled with negative thoughts.	POSITIVE
Keep in mind that many breast lumps are not cancerous,even suspicious ones...and I hope the same for you too.	POSITIVE
Please let us know when you receive your biopsy results and lets hope for a favorable outcome.	NEUTRAL
Take care..	NOT_LABELED
Ok I'll let you know.	NEUTRAL
I just had a look to the sonographers report and she wrote cystic and solid components present with calcifications.	NEUTRAL
That's a good thing right?	POSITIVE
I am sure that your Doctor can explain to you in details your complete Ultrasound report.	NEUTRAL
In your first post,you mentioned that the Radiologist stated that the lump may represent a Fibroadenoma but now you say that it's a cyst containing solid components.All I can tell you is that breast cysts can be classified as either simple or complex cysts.	NEUTRAL
Simple Cysts (fluid filled sacs) have virtually no chance of containing malignancy.	NEUTRAL
However,complicated cysts are a little more concerning.	NEUTRAL
They are also fluid filled sacs but contain some solid material (debris).	NEUTRAL
Usually complicated cysts are aspirated and have the cells examined to better evaluate the nature of the cyst and the majority will results in benign findings when biopsied.	NEUTRAL
I am sorry if I cannot help you more,but I would advise you to visit your Doctor concerning your Ultrasound results,because he/she would be your best source of information.	NEUTRAL
Ok thanks.	NOT_LABELED
Yeah what's happened is I have a copy of what the sonographer wrote, and the final report of what the radiologist wrote.	NEUTRAL
This is where there are different descriptions.	NEUTRAL
Sonopgrapher wrote cystic and solid components but the final report has what I wrote originally.	NEUTRAL
Even I'm confused as to who is correct!	NEGATIVE
I just responded to your private message.	NEUTRAL
What are the chances treating this type of cancer with radiation only?	NEUTRAL
Does the statistics change any and if so, can you tell me the percentage!	NEUTRAL
Hi. Invasive ductal carcinoma cannot be cured by radiation alone.	NEUTRAL
At the very least, a mastectomy or lumpectomy (surgery removing a part of the breast along with the tumor) should be done.	NEUTRAL
If the tumor is small (less than or equal to 0.5 cm) and no tumor spread to the axillary nodes was found, then radiation treatment after the surgery may suffice.	NEUTRAL
But a larger tumor or metastases to the axillary nodes will require the addition of either chemotherapy or hormonal treatment, or both.	NEUTRAL
I recently under went a lumpectomy in July, I also has lymph nodes involved.	NEGATIVE
The tumors were removed, my margins came back clear.	POSITIVE
I don't want to go through chemotherapy, I am willing to do radiation along with hepercin will this help me at all?	NEUTRAL
I think what the doctor is trying to tell you is that surgery in your case is necessary, and which you now say you had.	NEUTRAL
He also said that especially if lymph nodes are involved, chemotherapy is highly recommended and the right way to go in your case.	NEUTRAL
It will not guarantee that you will live forever but it will increase your chances of living longer.	POSITIVE
I do understand what you are saying, after all mt tests from the muga scan to the mri bone scat and cat scan.	NEUTRAL
Blood work and so on, after all the tests came back would the doctors know if the cance has spresd to other area outside of my lymph nodes?	NEUTRAL
Hi.	NOT_LABELED
If the cancer has been found in the lymph nodes, there is a significant probability that there is already microscopic spread to other areas of the body.	NEUTRAL
This microscopic spread may not be easily detected by conventional imaging procedures.	NEGATIVE
So even if the initial tests were negative for distant metastases, if the lymph nodes are already involved, it is imperative to do some additional treatment like chemotherapy, since we are not sure that the negative results are totally reliable.	NEUTRAL
Is there a time lime to have chemotherapy?	NEUTRAL
, right now I am unable to have the chemotherapy due to financial reason.	NEGATIVE
I am not counting it out all together maybe sometime next year?	NEUTRAL
This is what I have been told.	NEUTRAL
When you are first diagnosed, a team of doctors set up your treatment plan.	NEUTRAL
(or a doctor/doctors talk about what they think is the best thing to do in any particular case for the best possible outcome and prevention of reoccurrence).	NEUTRAL
Then , if the patient agrees to this, you go ahead with it.	NEUTRAL
If you do, then the initial treatments are really the most important of all the treatment, as the goal is to wipe out whatever cancer there is and may be lurking the very first time.	NEUTRAL
If you decide to do chemo a year or so later, this will no longer be part of the initially recommended treatment that according to the doctor's best judgement has the highest chance of working in your best interest.	NEGATIVE
Radiation will certainly help with reoccurrence, and it will attack whatever may have spread outside of the surgical area that was removed.	POSITIVE
But as the doctor above explains, with positive lymph nodes there is a chance that the cancer has spread, and in half of the cases those lesions are so tiny that they won't show up on a bone scan or other test.	NEUTRAL
So, this is why chemotherapy is utilized to make sure that if this spread is there it is wiped out by chemo immediately, because after the first chance the cancer will only spread and grow.	NEUTRAL
(I mean even with radiation, it will grow outside of the radiation area).	NEGATIVE
Radiation is local treatment just like surgery, and chemo is systemic.	NEUTRAL
So is tamoxifen but it's not indicated in your case.	NEUTRAL
Do not put off chemo because of financial reasons.	NEUTRAL
There are breast cancer advocate organizations that can help you get treatment.	POSITIVE
I think one of them is called youcanthrive.org, or something close to that.	NEUTRAL
Find an advocate and get the treatment you need.	NEUTRAL
Your LIFE is more important than financial considerations.	NEUTRAL
NOBODY in this country should have to risk recurrence of a life threatening disease because they can't afford treatment.	NEGATIVE
I had Stage 3 Invasive Ductal Carcinoma in 09.	NEGATIVE
Treatment included 2 lumpectomies, chemotherapy and radiation.	NEUTRAL
When cancer reaches your lymph nodes, you have no idea where the cancer cells have traveled through your body, therefore chemotherapy treatment is necessary.	NEUTRAL
Do you know of any more of the advocate and financial support groups?	NEUTRAL
Thank you.	NOT_LABELED
4 1/2 years ago my mother has a cancerous lump taken out of her breast.	NEUTRAL
SHE DID NO TREATMENTs.	NEUTRAL
About a year ago she found another lump in the same breast but this time on the outside.	NEGATIVE
She found a doctor that has been treating it.	NEUTRAL
we thought it was getting better.	POSITIVE
Just a couple of months ago the same doctor who is in another state where we live ordered a bone scan her at home.	NEUTRAL
The results according to this doctor weren't good.	NEGATIVE
He said there was nothing else he could do.	NEGATIVE
We found a cancer doctor here at home.	NEUTRAL
It is now in her lymph notes under her arm and in her chest and she also has another lump in the same breast inside again.	NEGATIVE
It has been growing since her surgery 4 1/2 years ago.	NEGATIVE
This doctor said it is not in any of her organs .	NEUTRAL
All the natural stuff my mom was taking saved her organs.	POSITIVE
It is in her bones now.	NEGATIVE
The doctor here will have them in a week.	NEUTRAL
It only will be than that he will know what bones and how many the cancer is now in.	NEUTRAL
Is it true once it reaches the bones it is stage 4?	NEUTRAL
What can we expect, She also starts chemo in one week.	NEUTRAL
I'm so sorry to learn of your Mother's present condition.	NEUTRAL
Evidently she received very poor medical care when her first cancer was discovered.	NEGATIVE
The fact that she now has metastisis to the bone isn't the main issue as bone mets is quite easliy managed.	NEUTRAL
The lymph node involvement is the problem to be addressed first.	NEGATIVE
I truly hope that you are being treated by an Oncologist and that she will not refuse whatever treatment that is recommended.	NEUTRAL
The only proven treatment for cancer at any stage is a combination of Chemotherapy, Radiation and possible Hormone Therapy following the appropriate surgery at the time the cancer is first discovered.	NEUTRAL
As far as prognosis at this point; that would be something you should discuss with your Mother's Oncologist as he/she has all the necessary information regarding the cancer.	NEUTRAL
Kindest regards ...	NOT_LABELED
So sorry to learn of your mother's health.... The first doctor apparently did not do his job aty all.	NEGATIVE
By all means, seek the assistance of a good oncologist -- but listen to his/her recommendations.	NEUTRAL
They will almost always without a doubt recommend the chemotherapy protocol, which has NOT been proven to help the majority of those receiving it (less than 15%).	NEGATIVE
Remember one thing -- and that is an oncologist job is to educate and inform patients only of what they are taught and told to relate to patients.	NEUTRAL
Please do your research for your mother -- it can save her life and give her peace of mind as well as quality of life.	NEUTRAL
My prayers are with you.	POSITIVE
I've only gotten 2 responses to my post which either tell me there is something someone does't want to tell me or my concerns aren't enough.	NEGATIVE
Thanks for nothing.	NEGATIVE
I am so sorry to hear about your mother's health.	NEUTRAL
I can certainly appreciate your concern and your wish to get concrete answers.	NEUTRAL
I am in a similar position having been recently diagnosed with metastases to the bones.	NEGATIVE
From what I understand this means that the cancer is in stage IV.	NEUTRAL
Information on the computer suggests that mets to the bone and not to the vital organs are considered the ""best"".	POSITIVE
My doctor said that she has seen a few patients live for 10 years in this condition.	NEUTRAL
The danger is that the cancer will move to vital organs.	NEUTRAL
If you look on the computer the statistics for life with metastatic cancer are grim (2-3yrs) I have been assured that life expectancy can be much longer if the cancer can be stabilized.	POSITIVE
I am hoping that this will be true for me and I definitely hope that this will be true for your mother.	POSITIVE
I hope that this is somewhat helpful.	POSITIVE
I don't think any one, cancer patient or oncologist, is quick to put a life expectancy in absolute terms.	NEUTRAL
I do understand, however, the wish to have certainty in such a vulnerable situation.	NEUTRAL
Best wishes, jonji.	NOT_LABELED
I'm sorry you felt that your concerns were not answered.	NEUTRAL
I re-read your original post and found the only question to be ""was bone mets considered Stage 4"" ..	NEUTRAL
Obviously your mother either refused treatment when she was first diagnosed and this is certainly the main reaosn for the recurrance.	NEGATIVE
Natural remedies DO NOT prevent or cure breast cancer.	NEGATIVE
As I mentioned before, bone mets can be managed quite well and there are many Stage IV women who alive and living with the bone mets.	POSITIVE
If you would like some information from some of those Stage IV survivors you might visit the following website which is a discussion group and there are some amazing women there who are more than willing to share their experiences as Stage IV Survivors.	POSITIVE
Your Mother's Oncologist remains the best source of information regarding her particular case.	NEUTRAL
Check out this website though if you have time: bcsupport.org.	NEUTRAL
I thought you answered her question very wellï¿½ and I read most all of your replies which are great.	POSITIVE
You are very knowledgable and helpful to this board.	POSITIVE
But I can't help but askï¿½	NEUTRAL
why did I get kicked off this board when I gave one woman a website to go too?	NEGATIVE
She had a very aggressive type of breast cancerï¿½ the type I have which is ""Her2/neu"".	NEGATIVE
She was in a panic and very upset and was getting no replies.	NEGATIVE
(And believe me when your 1st dx with bc...its urgent that someone answer you asap because you are scared to death!)	NEGATIVE
So I tried to help her and replied the best I can because I know quite a bit about Her2 bc.	NEUTRAL
And ""one"" part of my reply to her was a message board that is JUST for ""Her2/neu"".	NEUTRAL
The board I told her about is up to date on everything Her2 related.	NEUTRAL
They have all the clinical trials...can direct you to the best doctors that understand this type of cancer and every new treatment that's out to fight it.	NEUTRAL
So I very nicely said please check out this website and the woman here will be very supportive and can answer all your questions about Her2.	POSITIVE
She was very apperciative and has recieved so much help once she went to the Her2 board I told her about.	POSITIVE
But the minute I did that I immediately got a PM from MedHelp telling me I was no longer to post here and they removed my user name.	NEGATIVE
(Something to that affect) .	NEGATIVE
They didn't even give me a chance.	NEGATIVE
Here I was spending my valuable time trying to help these scared woman since I've been in their shoes...	NEGATIVE
and I get kicked off the board for being NICE.	NEGATIVE
(What's up with that?)	NEGATIVE
They could at least warn a person NICELY and say the rules of the board and not to post OTHER websites or you will be expelled premanetly.	NEGATIVE
But no...they ""weren't"" nice about it at all.	NEGATIVE
I even wrote them back to explain the same thing I'm tell you but they did NOT care and rather I just go away.	NEGATIVE
There are NOT very many people here to answer questions...	NEUTRAL
so why they would chase someone like me away that is honestly trying to help someone is beyond me.	NEUTRAL
(I don't post or reply often now since they did that).	NEGATIVE
I waited about a month and decided to sign up under another name in order to help these poor woman that need answers.	NEUTRAL
But I'm still upset the way I was treated.	NEGATIVE
I've been on alot of message boards over the last 25 yrs and I've never been treated like that.	NEGATIVE
You just posted another website in order to help this person that was very distressed and upset which I think was VERY KIND of you and approperiate considering her circumstances.	POSITIVE
So I'm just curious why they were so quick to kick me off even when I APOLOGIZED for giving this girl the name of a website?	NEGATIVE
I was ""not"" spamming the board with websites...and thats how I was treated for offering ONE girl one website for a very aggressive type of cancer.	NEGATIVE
I just don't get it.	NEGATIVE
(Had I known it was breaking a RULE or something...I would of gladly PM'd her the website)	NEUTRAL
They did not kick you off this board for handing out another website for this person?	NEUTRAL
Just me.	NOT_LABELED
I see nothing wrong with someone helping another.	NEUTRAL
I will probably get kicked off for this one too...just watch.	NEGATIVE
If this board has rulesï¿½everyone should have to follow themï¿½	NEUTRAL
why did they just single me out?	NEGATIVE
I'm usually one 3 boards to help others... and occasionally someone will post a special board thats only for stage IV, or Metsters, Her2/neu, lung cancer, etc...and no one gets kicked of any of those board for trying to direct someone to find help for their situation.	NEUTRAL
It's always bothered me that Medhelp jumped on me like that.	NEGATIVE
I was brand new here and trying to help all the newly dx...so much for that.	POSITIVE
Hasn't medhelp heard of warnings or telling someone thats not allowed verses just KICK them off the board for good.	NEGATIVE
Sorry...ticks me off.	NEGATIVE
That wasn't fair.	NEGATIVE
I'm WAS a stage IIIA, Her2/neu, 3+++ survivor which was just dx stage IV last week.	NEGATIVE
My time is valuable to meï¿½important.	NEUTRAL
I just LIKE to HELP peopleï¿½ not cause problems or hurt anyone.	POSITIVE
I just didn't like that way I was treated.	NEGATIVE
Now I see you post a website and thats ok...but its not for me.	NEGATIVE
Medhelp should only have one set of rules...not a double standard.	NEUTRAL
And believe me...this post is with ALL DUE RESPECT for you.	NEUTRAL
You do good work here!:)	POSITIVE
I guess I've been holding this in a long time and life is SHORT...well it will be for meï¿½so I wanted to get this out.	NEGATIVE
They can always delete this and kick me off again.	NEGATIVE
Whatever works for them.	NEUTRAL
Its no loss to me if they kick me off again...only to the people posting here that lose.	NEGATIVE
Keep up the ""great"" work Japdip...	POSITIVE
your are fast to respond to everyones questions and that alone is very important.	POSITIVE
When dx with bc...the answers can't come fast enough.	NEUTRAL
Waiting is the hardest part for us.	NOT_LABELED
Peace...	NOT_LABELED
take care.	NOT_LABELED
Keep up the good work.	POSITIVE
Rinda.	NOT_LABELED
I am so sorry you got another diagnosis of cancer.	NEGATIVE
I am sending prayers your way that you get the correct treatment and that you recover again.	POSITIVE
And I'm sorry you've had a tough time posting.	NEGATIVE
I value your posts and I believe other women do as well.	POSITIVE
I ran into the same issue and I was fortunate to get a moderator who allowed me to explain why I post about BRCA and use a certain website for women to get more information.	POSITIVE
I was given an opportunity to share all of the research available there and they saw that it was of value to the people who visit medhelp.	POSITIVE
Apparently it's against their terms of service, something about competing sites.	NEUTRAL
I do understand why you would offer that website to someone desperate for information and I know your heart is in the right place.	POSITIVE
We advocate for women with breast cancer.	NEUTRAL
We try to help however we can.	NEUTRAL
Even if it's just a cyber hug.	NEUTRAL
(You may want to check into the PARP inhibitor studies going on right now for metastatic breast cancer).	NEUTRAL
My thoughts and prayers are with you.	POSITIVE
Best wishes.	NOT_LABELED
Just wanted to pipe in and say I am so glad you are active on this Web site and that I have gotten gotten a lot out of your posts!	POSITIVE
(I know from personal experience that the rules are applied very unevenly)	NEGATIVE
I am sorry that you are now in Stage 4.	NEGATIVE
My thoughts and prayers are with you.	POSITIVE

I'm a 31 year old stage 4 breast cancer patient, currently in chemotherapy.	NEUTRAL
I've had severe postoperative pain from the mastectomy I had almost three years ago which my doctor has been treating with a steadily escalating series of opiate drugs: vicodin, then norco, then oxycodone...	NEGATIVE
now she wants me to start the Fentanyl patch, and I'm a little scared of it.	NEGATIVE
It seems so serious (like something you only take if you're...y'knowï¿½close to death!Which I'm not!)	NEGATIVE
And it scares me that so many people seem to become so addicted to it, and I'm scared that I'll be too tired to be responsible, raise my three year old son, etc...	NEGATIVE
My doctor answered all the questions I asked of course but I have to admit I didn't press too hard because I didn't want her to think I was afraid of becoming an addict...	NEGATIVE
I mean, I still need help with this ****amn pain in my (ex) breast...	NEGATIVE
it just seems like once I start this patch, there's no going back!	NEGATIVE
Does anybody have any positive experience with the Fentanyl patch?	NEUTRAL
Did anybody use it for pain and then...get off of it one day?	NEUTRAL
Did it keep you from normal day-to-day responsibilities?	NEUTRAL
I'm just a little nervous.	NEGATIVE
Thanks.	NOT_LABELED
absolutly DO NOT TAKE FENTYNAL PATCHES!	NEGATIVE
i am 36 years old and i had breast cancer to they gave me fentynal.	NEUTRAL
i regret ever taking it it has ruined my life!	NEGATIVE
Jessie: What happened, if you don't mind my asking?	NEUTRAL
Did you become addicted to the fentanyl?	NEGATIVE
Would something else have been better for the postop chronic pain?	NEUTRAL
I hope your cancer is in remission, by the way--- this all *****.	NEUTRAL
I'm scared of pain, scared of my cancer, scared of being too involved with pain meds to be a good mom...	NEGATIVE
I'm scared of a lot these days...	NEGATIVE
Emily.	NOT_LABELED
DO NOT TAKE!	NEGATIVE
This drug is really only meant for the terminally ill!	NEGATIVE
Its the most horrible pain medicine to come off of.	NEGATIVE
I was not addicted to it and had no idea I was going on the strongest pain medicine in the world.	NEUTRAL
It is 100x stronger than morphine and 50 x stronger than herion.	NEUTRAL
It causes all kinds of side effects.	NEGATIVE
I had a friend on it for 3 weeks and she wanted to die when she was tapering off of it.	NEGATIVE
This drug is hell and is not worth it.	NEGATIVE
Stay away!	NEUTRAL
You will thank me!	POSITIVE
I had to learn the HARD way!	NEGATIVE
Wowï¿½so sorry to hear all this.	NEUTRAL
I am tapering off Oxycodones and even though it has been tough, I am sticking to my schedule and doing well.	POSITIVE
I would definetly do all the research you can on your own before taking anything like this for pain.	NEUTRAL
Just like jessie and shellbell said, these drugs can and will ruin your life.	NEGATIVE
I don't think Doctors really understand how easily a person can go from taking these meds as prescribed to getting way out of control with them.	NEGATIVE
A few years ago, a friend of my brothers was given Fentanyl patches for his back after a botched surgery.	NEUTRAL
At the time, he was only 32...	NEUTRAL
Within a few months, he was taken off them and started into withdrawal....and within a couple days after that, he was in Intensive Care at the Hospital....yep...	NEGATIVE
he almost died from w/d.	NEGATIVE
They had to put him back on it and tried to taper him off them slowly....but he ended up getting so sick and desperate, he started seeking out street drugs.	NEGATIVE
He lost his job, his wife left and took the kids, he lost his home and vehicle...	NEGATIVE
everything.	NOT_LABELED
This only took less than a year because of his need for the drugs....and he ultimately committed suicide....	NEGATIVE
it was a tough loss for everyone.	NEGATIVE
It is devastating what these types of medicines can do.	NEGATIVE
I have read so many stories that reflect how I was about the medicines.	NEUTRAL
I was ""dumb"" about them and never really did any real research on how they work or what they do....once I did discover this, I knew I had to get off them...	NEGATIVE
but fear kept me from trying.	NEGATIVE
It wasn't until a few months ago that I really started talking to my Doctor about wanting to get off them and now I am really glad I did....	POSITIVE
I hope we caught it before it had a chance to get totally out of control...but I will say it was becomming a real problem.	NEGATIVE
I hope you are able to find something for your pain....nothing worse than hurting all the time.	NEGATIVE
God Bless.	NOT_LABELED
Hi, I'm sorry to hear you are having such a pain problem.	NEGATIVE
My concern about the fentanyl patches is that the side effects can continue to increase even though the pain relief effect has begun to diminish.	NEGATIVE
This can lead to oversedation or in some cases even death, esp.	NEGATIVE
if the patient then takes additional analgesics to try to obtain adequate pain relief...	NEUTRAL
My suggestion would be for you to enroll in a pain clinc, if you have not already done so, so that your pain can be closely monitored and managed by a doctor who is a specialist in this area of medicine.	NEUTRAL
Besr wishes...	NOT_LABELED
i also would not start with them.	NEUTRAL
I once used fentanyl patchen when I was in so much pain from a condition called osteonecrosis where my femur was dying, and it was so painful that 8-10 oxycodone did not do the trick.	NEUTRAL
the fentanyl was perfect, and after starting it I was able to walk again normally and a few weeks later the condition healed/resolved itself.	POSITIVE
(of course you will never know unless you are not on the drug so instead of changing the patch every three days I kept it on for 4 to wait for the pain to come back and then one day it no longer did)	NEGATIVE
It was horrible coming off it, and when I told the oncologist's nurse she told me that was ridiculous and she has never heard of anyone having withdrawels from it, even people who took much higher dose.	NEGATIVE
I guess they all died and therefore had to not deal with withdrawal.	NEGATIVE
Anyway, I took hydrocodone to do so.	NEUTRAL
Yes, it is incredible for pain but I did no like the effect it has on me spirit wise; I felt depressed on it.	NEGATIVE
I have since heard that drugs like oxycodone and vicodin are much more abused than fentanyl for just that reason.	NEUTRAL
I don't think it's a 'feel good' drug but incredibly powerful otherwise.	POSITIVE
No, I would not either.	NOT_LABELED
Kat.	NOT_LABELED
Hi, I suggest you go to a pain management group.	NEUTRAL
There are lots of options.	NEUTRAL
My wife was stage 4 and tried all options.	NEUTRAL
She wasn't able to handle any pain medicine except for darvicet.	NEUTRAL
My rub down and long car rides were her main source of relief.	POSITIVE
Please see an expert on pain management.	NEUTRAL
No drug is bad if it keep you from having pain.	POSITIVE
All my best.	NOT_LABELED
Kemal.	NOT_LABELED
Wow.I'm sorry to see all the misinformation on this thread about the fentanyl patch.	NEGATIVE
Yes, it's a very strong pain medication, but that's why it is dosed in MICROgrams instead of MILLIgrams.	NEUTRAL
That is a huge difference.	NEUTRAL
It is no more or less ""addicting"" than any other narcotic pain medication.	NEUTRAL
It doesn't matter if you use the fentanyl patch, hydrocodone, oxycodone or morphine.	NEUTRAL
If you take any of these drugs on a regular basis your body will become physically dependent upon it.	NEUTRAL
If you do not taper off slowly, you will experience withdrawal symptoms.	NEUTRAL
The presence of withdrawal does not mean the patient is an addict.	NEUTRAL
Addiction is a totally different problem involving abuse and overuse of a particular substance.	NEUTRAL
The fentanyl patch comes in many doses from 12.5 mcg (micrograms) per hour to 25, 50, 75 and 100 mcg.	NEUTRAL
The 25 mcg/ hour patch is equal to about 8 norco tablets a day, yet most people don't think twice about swallowing that much hydrocodone.	NEUTRAL
The fentanyl patch is prescribed for many kinds of chronic pain, not just for those who have a terminal condition.	NEUTRAL
Please don't live your life in pain if you don't have to.	NEUTRAL
Fentanyl, like any other opiate pain medication, is just a tool to help with pain.	NEUTRAL
Yes, it can be misused and abused, but so can any other opiate.	NEUTRAL
If you work with your doctor and taper off when you no longer need it, you won't have to worry about withdrawal.	NEUTRAL
Unless you have an underlying medical condition like a cardio-pulmonary problem, withdrawal won't kill you.	NEUTRAL
The biggest danger is from dehydration in people who suddenly discontinue opiate therapy and can't cope with the vomiting and/or diarrhea.	NEGATIVE
Jaybay says:     'Wow.I'm sorry to see all the misinformation on this thread about the fentanyl patch	NEGATIVE
Jaybay, you cannot call an opinion coming from personal experience 'sorry misinformation'.	NEGATIVE
your comment makes me pretty sure that you have never used a fentanyl patch?	NEUTRAL
Not 100 inserts, or books, or doctor's and/or nurse's advice on fentanyl comes even close to the value of reporting from 'personal experience', and I am impressed that pretty much all of us who have used fentanyl, or had a friend whose experience they are familiar with, has stringly advised against the drug, unless nothing else controls the pain.	NEGATIVE
and fentanyl is not nearly as abused as other narcotics, so it's not 'the same' as all the others, because it is not a 'feel good' drug.	NEGATIVE
Katrin.	NOT_LABELED
As I mentioned in my post above, fentanyl patches pose serious risks.	NEGATIVE
And it does not have to be misused or abused to be dangerous!	NEGATIVE
There are problems inherent in this delivery system for the medication.	NEGATIVE
At least two patients in our practice died while using them, as did one of my neighbors.	NEGATIVE
The mother of another pt. suffered life-threatening respriatory depression, but was saved because her family got her to the hospital just in time.	NEGATIVE
Here is a quote from an article about this problem, and a link to that article: ""Since the Duragesic patch was first introduced by Johnson & Johnson in 1994, there have been a number of reported problems with fentanyl pain patches due to manufacturing issues.	NEGATIVE
At least seven different recalls of fentanyl patch systems have been issued by Johnson & Johnson and companies manufacturing generic versions of the patch, raising questions about whether the powerful painkiller can be safely made.	NEGATIVE
Hundreds of fentanyl pain patch overdose deaths have been associated with different versions of the patch, and dozens of fentanyl patch wrongful death lawsuits have been filed against the various manufacturers.	NEGATIVE
http://www.aboutlawsuits.com/actavis-fentanyl-patch-recall-13686/ If you don't respect this article (because it's from a law Web site, just search the terms ""fentanyl patch recalls""and ""fentanyl patch side effects""and you will find many, many other references.	NEUTRAL

Thank you, bb, for this very objective post, and which complements the other posts derived from personal experience of people who have used the patch, and which is what eliandbasilsmom asked for.	NEUTRAL
Both, providing objective information, preferably with a link attached, and personal experience are what makes a forum like this so valuable to those who want to 'know' something 'real' .	POSITIVE
eliandbasilsmom asks:   'Does anybody have any positive experience with the Fentanyl patch?	NEUTRAL
Did anybody use it for pain and thenï¿½ get off of it one day?	NEUTRAL
Did it keep you from normal day-to-day responsibilities?	NEUTRAL

I have been on the fentanyl patch for a year now - I have not had one problem with it!	POSITIVE
My pain is caused from Stage 4 BC with mets to the bones and lungs.	NEUTRAL
I am still using the patch - 175 mcg's every 3 days plus oxycodone - 6 to 8 a day plus doing the chemo (chemo for 3 years).	NEUTRAL
I have not had any side effects and am pleased with how the patch is working!!	POSITIVE
I have been on varying doses over the Fentanyl patch for 3+ years & am currently trying to slowly taper down.	NEUTRAL
I've tried this a few times before & EVERY time the withdrawals are so severe that I end up hospitalized & once even on life support.	NEGATIVE
This time has been absolute hell & I STRONGLY urge that NO ONE uses this DRUG !!!	NEGATIVE
I was not told by my dr when it was prescribed how bad it was & I couldn't find any information online.	NEGATIVE
Within a week of starting it I could feel the difference & everyone around me could see differences in me.	NEGATIVE
I HAVE NEVER ABUSED THE DRUG, take it EXACTLY as prescribed & still have a dependence to them.	NEGATIVE
I'd LOVE to come off them, but at this time am pregnant & to try & come off now is pretty much a death sentence for both of us.	NEGATIVE
I have been pregnant before on this horrible drug & did carry to term.	NEGATIVE
She went through 2 weeks in the NICU with withdrawals which were the HARDEST 2 weeks of my life.	NEGATIVE
She is a happy & healthy above average 2 yr old who loves everything.	POSITIVE
I pray every night that this child I am carrying is healthy & pray that he'll do ok.	POSITIVE
I'm withdrawaling pretty bad right now due to a miscalculation by my dr so right now I can SAFELY tell you that NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO YOU WILL BECOME ACCUSTOM TO THESE HORRID PATCHES & WILL GO THROUGH WITHDRAWALS.	NEGATIVE
I don't want to see anyone suffer this if I can prevent it so PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THEM !!!!!!!!!!	NEGATIVE
I am so sorry to hear what you and your daughter have gone through, and what you are now going through with your current pregnacy!	NEUTRAL
Thank you for sharing your experience, which may be taken into consideration by others.	NEUTRAL
