hi, my doctor has come to the conclusion i have IBS after not showing any signs of chrons in a colonoscopy test .	EXPERIENCE
I have every symptom of chrons however: Ab pain, bowel changes, bloating, pain, have had red eyes, sore on leg that change colour when fading, mouth ulcers, etc	EXPERIENCE
my question is has anyone been diagnosed with chrons after having a clear colonoscpy?	FACT
Sorry ma'am but I was diagnosed with it after my bloodwork, colonoscopy and biopsies came back positive.	EXPERIENCE
Most people I have talked to that have Chrons also had the positive colonoscopy's which sealed the deal.	EXPERIENCE
Sorry.	NOT_LABELED
It is possible you have Crohn's in the small intestine, which will not show on a colonoscopy, as this only looks at the large intestine (colon).	OPINION
An upper endoscopy (to look at the oesophagus, stomach and small intestine) is another test to rule out Crohn's as biopsies can be taken of the tissue during the procedure.	FACT
Crohn's often starts around the terminal ileum (next to the appendix) and can progress to the whole GI tract (mouth to anus), as mine has done.	EXPERIENCE
A barium swallow through is another test to see any problems in the upper GI tract, but this is purely imaging, and biopsies cannot not be taken.	FACT
As far as I understand, the only conclusive proof of Crohn's is biopsy of affected tissue, looked at by a pathologist.	OPINION
IBS is a diagnosis of exclusion - after all available tests are completed and found negative for Crohn's or Ulcerative Colitis.	FACT
It is not an IBD auto-immune disease and in my opinion, a lazy diagnosis by doctors who cannot be bothered to do proper evaluations.	OPINION
Have you been tested for coeliac disease, as this can have similar symptoms to IBD?	FACT
Liz.	NOT_LABELED
I had something simular happen.	EXPERIENCE
I had surgery in August to remove a mass in my small intestine, in the terminal ileum and they biopsy said high probability of Crohns.	EXPERIENCE
However, when I had a colonoscopy and endoscopy 5 months later, it showed inflamation.	EXPERIENCE
and ulcers throughout my small intestine but this time negative on the Crohns.	EXPERIENCE
I don't really understand.	OPINION
The doctor said I could still have it but been in remission during that time.	EXPERIENCE
That makes no sense to me.	OPINION
So we still don't know if I have it or not.	FACT
I've had biopsy that said yes and one that said no, I guess.	EXPERIENCE
It just doesn't make sense to me.	OPINION
Still, the prescription is the same whether I have it or not, steriods to clear up the ulcers and inflamation.	FACT
I'm taking Entocort and Nexium.	FACT
The doctor told me as long as I'm still feeling pretty good by this Summer then won't need to see him again unless I get symptoms again.	FACT
He told me that doctor's are reluctant to diagnose Crohns unless they know definately it is Crohns because of insurance reasons.	FACT
I guess I can understand that.	OPINION
Still, I'd like to know if I have Crohns or if it's something else, what is it?	OPINION
You know?	NOT_LABELED
I hope you get a diagnosis soon.	OPINION
I can understand your frustration.	OPINION
I wish you well.	NOT_LABELED
Take care.	NOT_LABELED
thankyou both for your informative replies...	NOT_LABELED
I have heard of people who have chrons in the small intestines ...	EXPERIENCE
however when i asked my doctor whether or not this could be a possibility, he said if i had chrons it more than likely would have shown up in the bowel/colon and didnt want to talk any further.	EXPERIENCE
i feel very frustrated as i have looked into many chrons symptoms from people with chrons and have been through everything they have ..	EXPERIENCE
i was overwhelmed to finally find someone else going through what i have...	NOT_LABELED
i share your opinion of IBS being a lazy diognosis from a doctor ...	OPINION
i just dont think you can be as sick as i've been and it be that...	OPINION
and do you have to be having an attack of chrons for the colonoscopy/ endoscopy to pick up a positive result ...	FACT
or can it be picked up when youre not showing any symptoms?	FACT
....sounds like Aprils question!	NOT_LABELED
anyway ,isn't it just great when you get better..	OPINION
have had 5 weeks of hell and am now feeling normal again!	EXPERIENCE
how are you girls feeling ?	NOT_LABELED

Ok I know I said it wrong, but for the last 2 woman who posted, I was reading that there are 5 different Crohns, not sure of all but remember the most common was the ilieum, then lg intestines, then beggining of sm.	FACT
intestines the duednum, from mouth to anus.	FACT
and in some the jejelum,(where they can see with the endo capsule camera, but not with regular endoscope or colonoscope??	FACT
I was wondering abt this myself??	NOT_LABELED
Any responses at the jejelum would be appreciated.	OPINION
Thanx,georgie.	NOT_LABELED
You can have Crohn's Disease anywhere in your digestive tract, from your lips to your anus.	FACT
It is most common in the colon, but it isn't exclusive.	FACT
Think of it as a mean thing living inside of you that can either attack one place or spread to another place, or MOVE to another.	FACT
This is why patients who have portions of their bowel removed, sometimes have Crohn's pop up in a new part.	FACT
I would recommend getting a capsule endoscopy.	OPINION
You swollow a camera in a pill that sends photos every three seconds to a machine that you wear around your stomach for the day.	FACT
It does not hurt at all and it eventually comes out naturally like anything else.	FACT
trust me ,when a doctor does a colonoscopy,he goes into the small intestines, most people with crohns has it in the iliuem.i got dignosed with crohns disease in the year 2000,.	OPINION
and just last year got dignosed with ulcerative colitis and diverticulis.just got out of hospital in time to celebrate christmas,was in hospital 7 times last year with it not fun.if you feel you need a second oppion get one.	EXPERIENCE
crohns can even affect the eyes.	FACT
my eyes look like there bleeding,my tongue has ulcers it goes all the way to my abdmion,mostly right side but affects left side and my back.kidneys are being affected.im going to the cleveland clinic for my crohns now.this is not a disease i wish uppon anyone, both of you sound like you need a second oppion.	EXPERIENCE
I am in a similar situation and trying to get a second opinion at this point.	EXPERIENCE
I have been having intestinal problems since 2002 and just a year ago got a dr to finally find a colonoscopy necessary.	EXPERIENCE
I was diagnosed from that with non specific non ulcerative colitis.	EXPERIENCE
I suffer daily with mucousy diarhea, and abdominal cramping and pain.	EXPERIENCE
Recently I develped a peri rectal abcess and fistula that I am seeing a colorectal surgeon for, who informed me that I had been misdiagnosed by the first GI dr because the only two conditions that can cause that kind of fistula is crohns or ulcerative colitis.	EXPERIENCE
I have only been treated for the currest symptoms with hyoscamine and another med but I can't remember what it was offhand...started with an L i think but I couldn't handle the side effects from it.	EXPERIENCE
I am not getting much relief from the medications that I have been given.	EXPERIENCE
I am also being treated by my general dr for anxiety and depression disorder and for chronic insomnia.	EXPERIENCE
I really just think there is something much deeper going on here with all these different things going on.	OPINION
Anyone have any ideas or suggestions?	NOT_LABELED
I went undiagnosed for 12 years with Chrons.	EXPERIENCE
I was always told I had IBS but I knew different I was too sick for that.	EXPERIENCE
Through a colonoscopy there was some inflammation but they still did got get me a diagnoses (5 Colonoscopies later).	EXPERIENCE
It was not until my dr ran a specific blood test for Chrons that came back abnormal was I finally diagnosed with Chrons.	EXPERIENCE
Be very insistent, we know our bodies better than any dr out there.	OPINION
If you know something is wrong keep pursuing it.	OPINION
IBS not not include any inflammation internally and a fever and such.	FACT
Hope nobody ever has to wait as long as I did for help and treatment.	EXPERIENCE
Ask your doctor for a SED rate and CRP blood test.	OPINION
Ask for a genetic test to be done on your blood.	OPINION
It's expensive but conclusive.	FACT
Crohn's doesn't always show up in a colonoscopy.	FACT
Depends upon where it is located and that can change.	FACT
Prednisone is not for long-term therapy.	FACT
It destroys your teeth, muscles, tissues that can result in hip and shoulder replacements.	FACT
The disease ***** but you can control it with a positive attitude, healthy diet and proper medical care.	OPINION
I keep having rectal bleeding even though I use HC suppositories which help.	EXPERIENCE
My colonoscopy and endoscopy came back negative for Crohn's.	EXPERIENCE
Which blood tests do I need done to be sure?	FACT
I'm on prednisone 10mg/day for one month for my asthma and need it to breathe better and relax.	EXPERIENCE
I am in a similar position too...	EXPERIENCE
my problems started around two in a half years ago where i had extreme pain after eating any types of foods, followed by diarrhoea...	EXPERIENCE
sometimes the pain was everyday, sometimes once a week but whenever it was it was so painful i would almost faint and could barely walk..	EXPERIENCE
I started loosing weight, ive lost about 10kg since the pain first started.	EXPERIENCE
My pains only come about once every 2months now because i am careful with the amounts i eat and how much of certain foods i can eat, i have learnt to read my stomach and when i need to stop eating in order to stop the pain from coming.	EXPERIENCE
I have lost my appetite and i rarely feel hungry.	EXPERIENCE
Nearly every day i feel nauseous.	EXPERIENCE
On the days i dont have diarrheoa i tend to be constipated, sometimes i dont go for days.	EXPERIENCE
My stomach swells very easily too, half the time i look pregnant and i am a petite person.	EXPERIENCE
I have been to a gastrologist for my problem and had tests upon tests.	EXPERIENCE
I have had a colonscopy, endoscopy, blood tests, urine tests, stool tests and an xray and the only thing the doctor has found is that i am lactose intolerant which is far from the only problem i believe i have because even when i went on a lactose free diet for a month i was still experiencing the same problems, and now i pretty much eat lactose free butter, cheese, milk and yogurt.	EXPERIENCE
Recently i also bleed from my bottom and skin came out from somewhere inside.	EXPERIENCE
For a week after that i had mucus in my stool and now i keep getting anal fissures.	EXPERIENCE
Has anyone else had a similar problem?	NOT_LABELED
Can you still have Crohn's if your IBD blood work came back normal?	FACT
A CT revealed thickening between my intestine and bowel.	EXPERIENCE
The stomach pain gets me down so bad I can't function.	EXPERIENCE
I have felt pretty good the last few weeks with just mild cramping and diahrea.	EXPERIENCE
I have major joint pain and fatigue most of the time.	EXPERIENCE
The nausea is very bad at times also.	EXPERIENCE
I am an active person and these symptoms have slowed me down a lot.	EXPERIENCE
I am scheduled for an upper and lower GI next Wednesday...	EXPERIENCE
Any advice....:	NOT_LABELED

Well, the most common area for Crohn's disease to first strike is the terminal ileum which would be in the lower right quadrant.	FACT
HOWEVER, Crohn's colitis is not at all uncommon (not the same thing as Ulcerative colitis) AND Crohn's disease can strike ANYWHERE in the GI tract from mouth to anus so ....	FACT
Crohn's disease is a very individualistic disease.	FACT
Most crohnies do enounter diarrhea, but there are plenty of use who encounter constipation.	FACT
My gastro likes to do colonoscopies too.	FACT
My Crohn's struck first in the mid-ileum and there hasn't been involvement near the ileocecal valve.	EXPERIENCE
So WHY would I put myself thru that hor-eye-bull prep for a colonoscopy???	OPINION
IF a barium upper GI and SBFT doesn't give any answers, there is the CT Enterography, the MR Enterography and the Pill Camera Endoscopy.	FACT

if I find out anything different I will be sure to share please do the same I would love to know of any connection.	OPINION
I think mine is type 1 I get them on my face.	EXPERIENCE
On your face is herpes simplex1, in the genitalia it is herpes simplex 2.	FACT
I too have Crohn's and have ""cold sores"" - herpes simplex1.	EXPERIENCE
I have only once or twice had a breakout while also severely ill and in the hospital from the disease.	EXPERIENCE
I see no direct link to the illness except that as emg454 mentioned, herpes reacts to stress.	OPINION
When you are in a ""major"" flare up verses the everyday things that come with this illness, and anything else in your life that can be compounding the ""stress situation"" ie..family, kids, work, fear of losing job/medical benefits, possible surgery, ect...	OPINION
it all adds to the stress your body is under while trying to fend off the attack on our immune systems, therefore you could be susceptible to further outbreaks.	OPINION

now I have 'hemmroid-like' protrusions around my anus that bleed, and burn lightly...on a good day, and I have dealt with this for a year, outta fear of doctors.	EXPERIENCE
I have lived my life as a straight man and was even married to a wonderful woman......be safe, no matter how much you trust someone...	EXPERIENCE
I feel like damaged goods now.	EXPERIENCE
Take care.	NOT_LABELED
Hey guys, if you have any questions that still need answers please post a new question so we can help you out.	NOT_LABELED
Thank you!	NOT_LABELED
Hi Guys, I see this is a really old thread, but I want to share the info I have on this matter as it 's a top very close to my heart and I want to help anyone I can who is also struggling with these health issues...	FACT
I have struggled with IBS-C since I was a little girl, and contracted HSV2 about 5 years ago.	EXPERIENCE
I have dealt with weekly, if not daily, herpes outbreaks since my contracting it.	EXPERIENCE
I found when my gut acted up (pain, distention, bloating, constipation etc), I would get an outbreak within hours.	EXPERIENCE
Even taking Valtex at 1G per day didn't stop it.	EXPERIENCE
I work out regularly, eat a whole foods diet and have seen a therapist regularly to manage stress.	EXPERIENCE
Nothing helped, if anything it got worse over the years.	EXPERIENCE
I have only recently, in the past year, found out that the underlying cause of IBS is often a condition called SIBO (small intestinal bacteria overgrowth).	EXPERIENCE
This is when bacteria that is only meant to be in the large intestine makes its way up in to the small intestine.	FACT
This can cause damage to the mucosal lining of the small intestine as well as create gas, blasting, constipation, diarrhea, food intolerances, chronic fatigue etc.	FACT
The reason this happens is due to low stomach acid, pancreatic exocrine function, and/or malfunctioning ileocecal valve.Bascially stress from emotions, food, drugs (recreational or pharma) all contribute to this problem.	FACT
The overgrowth of bacteria in the small intestine leads to a lot of endotoxins (waste) from the bacteria.	FACT
This waste damages the nerves surrounding in the gut leading to issues with motility (constipation, diarrhea), and weakens the immune system.	FACT
This is what lead to an opportunity for the herpes virus to express itself in me regularly.	EXPERIENCE
It took me years to find this out.	EXPERIENCE
I thought I was being punished and was always going to have this health situation, but luckily, I don't.	OPINION
To heal SIBO, you need to have a doctor or nutritionist supervise and provide a healing protocol via a diet called 'Low FODMAP"", and one, to several rounds of either pharmaceutical or herbal antibiotics to rebalance the microbiome.	FACT
The low FODMAP's diet will reduce inflammation and help to starve the bacteria.	FACT
Most find a huge relief in symptoms from cutting out high FODMAP foods alone, but that's only half the battle.	FACT
You need the anti-microbials and re-inocculation.	FACT
Testing for SIBO is key.	OPINION
You can do so through a Naturopath or Nutritionist.	FACT
It's important to know you have it for sure.	OPINION
Keep in mind, studies are now proving that SIBO is the underlying case of IBS, and can be cured with patience and diligence.	FACT
So, the link between IBS and herpes is real.	FACT
IBS/SIBO severely weakens the immune system and creates the space of the virus to wreak havoc.	FACT
When you get the gut micrbiome under control, the virus will not have the same opportunities to express itself.	FACT
I really hope this helps many of you struggling with this.	OPINION
I know it can seem like a hopeless issue and if I can add any other energy to this I'd say; please take self-judgement out of the mix.	OPINION
I know, easier said than done but at the end of the day it's just a virus.	OPINION
It doesn't define us.	NOT_LABELED
Self-judgment will only lead to more stress and we don't need more of that.	OPINION
And there is someone out there that will fully accept you the way you are.	OPINION
I promise you that.	FACT
Stay positive, full of optimism and self-love and don't settle.	OPINION
You can heal these issues.	OPINION

Before I was diagnosed with Crohn's colitis in 2005, I was experiencing alot of back pain which made it so I couldn't move around and I had never ever been in so much pain before!	EXPERIENCE
One day I was sunning and I couldn't get up!	EXPERIENCE
No matter which way I would try to help myself up I couldn't get up by myself.	EXPERIENCE
My husband had to lift me up to help me.	EXPERIENCE
This was the first thing that started happening to me before I started to get really sick with fevers, vomiting, diarhea, etc.	EXPERIENCE

Hi KentuckyBeMommaw, Before I was diagnosed I had the same problems.	EXPERIENCE
Even to the extent of not being able to move after lying down.	EXPERIENCE
I don't know if its connected to crohns e but I do know I had the same problems your describing.	EXPERIENCE
Now its been a couple of years and I still have a tough time with my back but nothing like before.	EXPERIENCE
I also have a lot of joint pain!	EXPERIENCE
That I am still trying to figure out what to do with.	EXPERIENCE
I haven't found any meds that work well for me and I don't want to go back on steroids.	EXPERIENCE
My recent flair up the dr. suggested steroids again but I chose to treat each complaint individually that is working for me so far (except for the joint pain).	EXPERIENCE
Have you heard any more about a connection between the two?	FACT
Ive only be diagnosed with crohns for a year now but I'm sure ive had it for years.	EXPERIENCE
I only have crohns in my small intestine and I only get pain in the low right side of my back.	EXPERIENCE
Almost like kidney pain.	EXPERIENCE
But I am postive it has to do with my crohns because it only happens when I have flares.	EXPERIENCE
iam only 27 i recently was diagnosed with crohnes after along few years first it was my gal bladder removed it.	EXPERIENCE
nope now a year ago they diagnosed me with endometerosus, and sence then my doctors just kept sayin it was that that was causing my lower back pain and abdomin.	EXPERIENCE
i stay in so much pain.and have several doctors for every little thing.	EXPERIENCE
i also have gerd and lactos intolerant.	EXPERIENCE
i know im young but it just seems like no one wanted to listin to me.	OPINION
i have been in and out of the emergency room.	EXPERIENCE
they have me on a few different meds that i see no difference in.	EXPERIENCE
they actully biopsied when they did my colonoscopy in november and it came back negative for crohnes but then i had to swallow a little capsel thats a camera to see inside my small intestines.	EXPERIENCE
and he showed me the pictures and said they were ulcers in my intestines but never offer meds for pain i finally asked for tramadole witch is useually used for fibermialga but it seems to help.	EXPERIENCE
but doctors apparently dont like to give pain meds but for people that have these kinda problems it should be necesary for all the people that abuse it now we cant even feel comfortable to ask i was so afraid to ask.	OPINION
people shouldnt be in that kinda pain.	OPINION
but my doctor said that its only 80% right he says hes possitive its crones.	EXPERIENCE
i also had a doctor tell me because i was bipolar he couldnt give me pain meds.	EXPERIENCE
because they have they tendency to be addictive/ i tell u i have seen a few doctors.	EXPERIENCE
i have no faith in them.	OPINION
i now go april 1st for a full hystarectamy because they think the pain again is from my endometerosis..	EXPERIENCE
i hope i have had several test and scops and surgerys and now they think because i have crohnes that its gonna complicate surgery there hopeing it will be in remission what ever thats suppose to mean.	EXPERIENCE
i dont have flairs my pain never goes away for a year a half now.	EXPERIENCE
im hopeing this does help cross my fingers.	OPINION
GO TO A CHIROPRACTOR!	OPINION
DO NOT START WITH PAIN MEDS!!	OPINION
I have had Ulcerative Colitis since I was 18, 12 years now, and have been through every med available.	EXPERIENCE
Two weeks ago I had the most severe back pain ever and did not want to go to my regular doctor for pain medication.	EXPERIENCE
There had to be something better than being on pain medication.	OPINION
I was told by several friends to see a chiroprator.	EXPERIENCE
THIS WAS THE BEST DECISION OF MY LIFE!	OPINION
I have been seeing a chiropractor for the last 3 weeks for my lower back pain, but I have noticed tremendous relief with my ulcerative colitis which was unexpected.	EXPERIENCE
I had always had discomfort in my lower back especially on my right side, like a pinched nerve feeling which made it very difficult to sleep on that side or even sit.	EXPERIENCE
The pain I felt prior to going to the chiropractor was that same pinched nerve feeling put right in the middle of my lower back which effected both sides of my body.	EXPERIENCE
After the x-rays my chiropractor took, I was shocked!	EXPERIENCE
There was a twist in my lower back that veered to the right (where all the pain of my colitis is located!	EXPERIENCE
) I have been pain free since my adjustments and am on a 10 week fix plan.	EXPERIENCE
Everything in our body is linked to our spine, that is where all our nerves control other parts of our body.	FACT
I never would have put two and two together, but it has brought tremendous relief to me that I could never have imagined!	EXPERIENCE
Remember: You have nothing to lose by going to the chiropractor first.	OPINION
Surgeries and Pain meds will stay with you for a lifetime!	FACT
Those should be your VERY LAST options!	OPINION
I have had the disease for two years now and I have only had about 10 days where I haven't had pain in my back legs knees shoulders and my abdomen without taking any meds.	EXPERIENCE
I was taking 16 pills a day to clam down the back pain along with my burning sensation in my abdomen.	EXPERIENCE
Finally I took Tramodol and that saved my life.	EXPERIENCE
If I don't take it when I get up the pain in my back, abdomen, pelvis and knees kills me.	EXPERIENCE
I work in surgery and I have to walk and stand on really hard floors so that doesn't help at all.	EXPERIENCE
I hate waking up in the morning with a burning sensation in my abdomen and the pain and weakness I occur when I sleep for more than 5 hours at a time.	EXPERIENCE
I went to a chiropractor and he really really screwed up my back.	EXPERIENCE
He hurt me more than I could imagine.	EXPERIENCE
So I started to go and get a message once a week and that helps a lot with my lower back pain.	EXPERIENCE
I have been on pentasa for the last 2 years and I think my body has become acustomed to the dosage and I have had 5 flair ups since January.	EXPERIENCE
I just got off a 3 month course of steroids and I felt wonderful for about 1 month now I'm back to the back pain, joint pain, the bloating abdomen pain and flair ups!	EXPERIENCE
I hate it.	OPINION
My Crohns doctor is best friends with my husband and he still can't help me.	EXPERIENCE
I think its a wicked disease that no one really understands and if you don't have it you don't really understand the pain that is involved with crohns.	OPINION
I have to live on Tramodol or else I'm in constant pain.	EXPERIENCE
I have to go off the tramodol for periods of times so I don't get addicted to it.	EXPERIENCE
And its those times I hate even moving!	EXPERIENCE
I hope my story can help those who have had these problems with Crohns.	OPINION
I don't think anyone will find a cure as of yet but time will come and maybe there will be light at the end of the tunnel.	OPINION
For now I take pain meds to help with the pain if I don't take them my life is pretty hard.	EXPERIENCE
Hey All, My name is Steve.... I have been diagnosed with Crohns about 14 years ago.	EXPERIENCE
Didnt have insurance so let it get really bad.	EXPERIENCE
Had 8-12 bowel mvmnts a day and thought I was in remission.	EXPERIENCE
How stupid of me.	OPINION
Got married...	EXPERIENCE
got insured...	EXPERIENCE
went to see one of the best Gastro's in Chicago.	EXPERIENCE
He asked how I was feeling.	EXPERIENCE
I told him everything and he said I was crazy.	EXPERIENCE
He scoped me and my CR is very inflamed.	EXPERIENCE
Put me on Prednisone for 2 months and Imuran indeffinatly.	EXPERIENCE
I went from 8-12 BM to 1-2 (talk about stupid ha?) Feeling great, but had to go back for another colonoscopy.	EXPERIENCE
I was positive everything was peachy-dory.	EXPERIENCE
Doc comes out says I am still inflamed and have strictures (intestine thickening and slowly closing).	EXPERIENCE
So now he prescribes Humira...	EXPERIENCE
I FREAK OUT.	EXPERIENCE
He is bringing out the big guns.	EXPERIENCE
I now find out that my insurance doesn't cover it AT ALL.	EXPERIENCE
My doctor who works in a University setting and is the Founder of the Illinois IBD Society is PISSED.	OPINION
Meanwhile puts me on Entocort.	EXPERIENCE
Everything is still great only now I can't sleep.	EXPERIENCE
I figured probably just nervous about all the new drugs.	EXPERIENCE
After sleeping about 5 hours in 4 days I gave up and called the Doc.	EXPERIENCE
He lowers my Entocort and prescribes antiaxiety (xanax-like) meds.	EXPERIENCE
I started sleeping better.	EXPERIENCE
Slowly coming off Entocort, and still not understanding why I am going through all of this when I am feeling just fine.	EXPERIENCE
(My wife is a resident and explained that I need to do what the Doc says).	EXPERIENCE
I get a message on my cell about 3 weeks ago from my Gastro doc (can we just agree that this doc is amazing) saying that he just got back from a meeting and met an executive from Abbott labs who said I maybe eligible for an assistance program.	EXPERIENCE
I fill out a ton of forms, answer a bunch of questions and found out I am getting Humira for a year for free.	EXPERIENCE
Starting in a week.	EXPERIENCE
Now I am starting to freak out about Humira....... SO..... Any suggestions on how to keep my Immune system working???	EXPERIENCE
I hope all you guys who are doing well keep well and those of you who are suffering to get better.	OPINION
Be aware that there are some types of arthritis that can go along with inflammatory bowel disease.	FACT
Insiste on being seen by a rheumatologist and having a complete blood work up and exrays.	OPINION
There are treatments, other pain relief meds, and chiropractor or massage can help but it is important that the cause is treated, not just the symptoms.	OPINION
Quick suggestion - Yes I suffer from Crohn's however i've just had the best blood results I've ever had.	EXPERIENCE
No I'm not in remission and yes I still suffer (particularly as I have already lost 5% of my spine mobility due to a previous accident).	EXPERIENCE
However the only thing I've done different since my last blood test is I've been eating a couple of handfuls of pepitas (pumpkin seeds - unsalted / unflavoured - just ""roasted"") a day - they have helped to reduce the inflammation - worth a try.....mind you - my back is killing me again at present and I'll do stretches etc to get it moving - i refuse to let this disease win.	EXPERIENCE
Hi I have been dx with crohn's for 9 yr. but Dr. have think i have had it since i was 15 yr now i am 30yr.	EXPERIENCE
Well anyways i do have back pain very bad a times (a long with all the other things that come along with this horrible disease).	EXPERIENCE
I have done some research on this what i have found It could be caused by inflammation of sacroiliac joint it in your back it called sacroiliitis or inflammation what the cause of other joints in that area.	EXPERIENCE
2nd muscle tension due to bowel inflammation 3rd osteoporosis due to poor absorption.Every place i looked said same thing , it maters what the cause is depends on treatment either meds message chiropractor hot bath.Hope this helps i feel your pain Good luck hope it get better.	EXPERIENCE
like the other posters suggested go see a Rhuematologist ASAP.	OPINION
I struggled with back pain for years with my Crohn's disease.	EXPERIENCE
I saw surgeons, chiropractors, pain docs, everything and nothing worked.	EXPERIENCE
Went to a Rhuematologist she immediately diagnossed me with an arthritis that was common in Crohn's patients and put me on medication that worked immediately and now I am pain free in my back.	EXPERIENCE
Luckily my uncle is a doctor and he is the one that suggested I see a Rhuematologist b/c I was considering having back surgery.	EXPERIENCE

Back pain prior to being diagnosed with ulcerative colitis.	EXPERIENCE
Doctor suspected it was colon related about 5 years before my diagnosis.	EXPERIENCE

Hi from London.	NOT_LABELED
I have similar stomach problems as those that you have described , I'm 44 years old and this problem started when I was 11 or 12 years old.	EXPERIENCE
I've recently been diagnosed with a condition named BILE SALT MALABSORBTION , Google it and see if it corresponds with your symptoms.	EXPERIENCE
Don't be fobbed off with useless doctors telling you that it's caused by stress , that doesn't help you at all does it.	OPINION
Good luck with it , it's not a nice problem to have and there's no real fix for it :-(  .	OPINION
I now take large quantities of a powder called COLESTYRAMINE (also know by different names).	EXPERIENCE
This powder does sometimes help settle it down , but as I have a particularly bad case of BSM the symptoms never totally disappear.	EXPERIENCE
When doctors fail to diagnose an ailment they often ascribe it to ""stress,"" or ""anxiety.	OPINION
or ""autoimmune,"" a term growing in popularity.	OPINION
I guess it hurts to say, ""I don't know what is wrong with you.	OPINION
Some of those on this forum may be suffering from a pathogen, in which case the most likely culprit is Candida albicans.	OPINION
There are cases of IBS, Crohn's and similar problems in my family.	EXPERIENCE
We are having early success by treating one of the sufferers for candidiasis.	EXPERIENCE
He is taking Lugol's solution since fungicides don't work and have serious side effects.	EXPERIENCE
I should mention that the proliferation of candida is often caused by sugar and starches, antibiotics, and prednisone and inhaled steroids.	FACT
Candidiasis is an under-diagnosed ailment.	OPINION
You have PROCTITIS, and Tenesmus which is very painful bowel-movements is a symptom of it.	OPINION
As the time goes by, the Proctitis just gets worse and worse, i.e., the pain during BM is just unbearable to the point that your toes and feet curl just like Bruce Willis did in Diehard..........................	EXPERIENCE
I had Proctitis for like 12 years and FIXED it with supplements that are Great for the brain which is a Big Bundle of Neurons because I reached the conclusion that I developed Proctitis from some really bad diahrea that I exposed myself to from Chinese food that I consumed for like 15 years.	EXPERIENCE
The explosive diahrea over the years caused my body to get DEFICIENT in some of those Micronutrients that are CRITICAL for neuronal health like Niacin, Magnesium, vitamin K2, etc.......	EXPERIENCE
The malfunctioning or INJURED nerves cause the immune system to attack JUST like it attacks other areas that are injured like a wrist when you sprain it, an infected cut, an insect bite, etc..	OPINION
To FIX those nerves you will need an account at swansonvitamins or any other supplement company to BUY:  Tripple Magnesium Complex 400mg/capsule, Balance B-100, Odor controlled garlic 500mg/capsule, Niacinamide 500 mg/capsule, Time-release vitamin c 1000 mg/capsule, vitamin k2, cayenne pepper capsule and any other supplement you feel like you will need like fish oil.........	OPINION
These are Great supplements for the brain and nerves, heart, bones, etc..  for example, google: ""vitamin k2 parkinson's"" or this one: ""vitamin k2 pancreatic cancer"" Start taking vitamin K2 to make sure YOU DON'T GET CANCER!	OPINION
Protocol for you to fix those nerves: -take 400 mg magnesium daily.	OPINION
take a B-100 capsule with each meal.	OPINION
take 2 of those 500 mg odor controlled garlic capsules with each meal if you can which comes out to some 6 capsules daily.	OPINION
Garlic is very important for fixing this so TAKE as much as you and others around you can tolerate.	FACT
Garlic is SULFUR and SULFUR IS NEEDED!	FACT
take at least 4 of those time-release vitamin c 1000 mg capsules daily so that your body can make the collagen that is needed in your skin.	OPINION
You may want to add L-Lysine to your vitamin-c so that your body can make Elastin which is also needed.	OPINION
take 3 vitamin K2 tablets every day and make sure to take a fish pill capsule every time you take a vitamin K2 capsule.	OPINION
You may consider vitamin k1 for this.	OPINION
Vitamin K2 is critical for the myelin covering nerves to be made in your body.	FACT
take 2 of those 500 mg Niacinamide capsules daily, one in the morning and other in evening after supper.	OPINION
experiment with just ONE cayenne capsule if you buy them but be sure to take it after one of your meals.	OPINION
Your body and nerves there in your colon took years to MALFUNCTION so DO NOT EXPECT RESULTS over night, but I do promise that the Garlic, sulfur, and other micronutrients will fix it IN less than 2 years, and you'll see results within weeks if you take as much of the micro nutrients as posted........	EXPERIENCE
It took my Proctitis about 2.5 years for me to declare myself healed with absolutely NO SYMPTOM.	EXPERIENCE
One more note, do you find yourself having cramps in your calf muscle like I did for years?????  I bet you do!	EXPERIENCE
This is a symptom of Magnesium deficiency!	OPINION
Also every time you go to your doctor your Heart rate is constantly above 90-near tachycardia.........This is also an indication of Magnesium deficiency.	OPINION
go to wikipedia and search: 'hypomagnesemia' then look at the symptoms, and I guarantee YOU WILL SEE THAT YOU ARE DEFICIENT IN JUST THIS ONE NUTRIENT!	OPINION
Niacin deficiency is characterized by 4 D's.... -Diahrea, dermatitis, dementia, death.	FACT
B6 and B12 and folate deficiency equals SHRUNKEN BRAIN which means you have lost Millions of Neurons.........	FACT
You are Deficient in B-vitamins, Magnesium, vitamin K2, VITAMIN C because of the daily diahrea!	FACT
TO fix the Neurons in the colon, you must take alot of these nutrients to counteract the effect of the diahrea so DO NOT DRINK caffeine or Alcohol during this period because these are diuretics and make you urinate alot so you urinate the micronutrients out, and YOU ALREADY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE DIAHREA DEPLETING your body of them.	OPINION
THE key to fixing these nerves is taking a bunch of those micronrutrients in my previous post JUST DO NOT take more than 400 mg of magnesium, any more than that and it will become a Laxative.	OPINION
To get more magnesium in your depleted body, Use Epsom Salt in your bathtub when you take a bath!!!!!	OPINION
They told me stress at 1st also!	EXPERIENCE
Turned out its Crohns Disease but I'm still screwed bc I was exposed 2TB when I was a Pharmaceutical Tech and the meds tht help Crohns I CANT TAKE BC OF THIS EXSPOSER 10+ YRS AGO IT REALLY ***** knowing whats wrong but still no help from my Gastro Dr!	EXPERIENCE
Look into LDN for Crohn's.......Buy a odor controlled garlic 500 mg/capsule from swanson because these will help you.	OPINION
taking those garlic tablets is like taking pure SULFUR!!!!! To convince yourself garlic plus all those supplements is what you need go to wikipedia and search ""Humira"" and look at the humira molecule to see all that sulfur...... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humira.	OPINION
allicin is one of molecules in garlic so look at the sulfur in molecule.... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allicin.	FACT
Try the garlic supplements to see how much they help with the inflammation, but you better add all the other supplements like I posted before you come down with problems like osteoporosis.	OPINION
Your problems could be from a variety of things.	OPINION
I had Achilles tendon surgery about two months ago and develop a weird symptom of having extreme foot pain when I need to have a bowel movement or during the bowel movement.	EXPERIENCE
It is a nerve issue.	EXPERIENCE
However, I do need to add that I also suffer from Ulcerative colitis (similar to Crohn's disease).	EXPERIENCE

If you have any advice please help, I feel lost!	OPINION
I have some problems swallowing and I frequently feel like there is something in my throat ready to come up.	EXPERIENCE
I was vomiting almost every night for about two weeks I then felt a little better and it only occurred every couple of days.	EXPERIENCE
Well right now I can't hold anything down.	EXPERIENCE
I'm afraid to eat, but I am hungry.	EXPERIENCE
I am now starting my days vomiting, sometime in the first couple of hours I wake up.	EXPERIENCE
I also started vomiting more than once a day.	EXPERIENCE
I went to the dr. last week with my son (mon.) I weighed 149.	EXPERIENCE
Today we went back for a med check for him and I weigh 139 (wed) I tried for a couple of years after the last steroids to lose weight but couldn't do it.	EXPERIENCE

I have nausea and vomiting and I can't sleep at night.	EXPERIENCE
Any advice..............PLEASE HELP!	NOT_LABELED
Hi - can only suggest you see a gastro soon and perhaps have an upper endoscopy, and/or small bowel follow through to check for any obstructions which may be causing the vomiting and swallowing problems.	OPINION
What meds are you on for Crohn's?	OPINION
Azathioprine made me vomit and have diarrhea at the same time -	EXPERIENCE
I only took it for 2 days and was so ill a doctor had to come to my home - he gave me an anti-nausea shot and advised me to stop the drug immediately.	EXPERIENCE
Since then I have been on methotrexate injections weekly and doing fine.	EXPERIENCE

Take care, Liz in Cornwall,England.	NOT_LABELED
Hi Liz, Thanks for the advice.	NOT_LABELED
I am taking Asacol right now.	EXPERIENCE
I took Azathiorine before and ya' I didn't care for it.	EXPERIENCE
Please keep in touch, its great talking to people who understand what I'm dealing with and who understand crohns.	OPINION
The closest support group to me is about 2 hours away And my poor husband and kids have never met anyone other than myself who has had crohns.	FACT
We are still learning so much.	OPINION
Thanks for your advice, its much appreciated!	OPINION
Hi there - not sure if I had Asacol, had so many different drugs over the past 38 yrs, as well as 30+ yrs of steroids - a no no now, but that was the only drug available to bring a flare into remission in those days.	EXPERIENCE
IBD drugs have come on in leaps and bounds in recent years, and although I am very stable on methotrexate there are some much newer drugs, anti-TNF biologic therapies, like Humira, Cimzia, Tysabril and Infliximab which gives one hope for the future.I don't know where you live, but believe these drugs are now available in the US but are still being trialled in the UK.	EXPERIENCE
My gastro said he has never known anyone tolerate methotrexate for 7 years without serious liver side effects, but guess I have always confounded general medical issues - didn't ""present"" normally with Crohn's - no pain, just severe diarrhea and weight loss, and when I got breast cancer 5 yrs ago, I had no palpable lump.	EXPERIENCE
It was found on a regular 3 yrly mammo, which is all we get here in England with our socialised health service.	EXPERIENCE
If I had known what I know now, I would have had private mammos in the intervening years, and perhaps the cancer would not have spread to my lymph nodes.	EXPERIENCE
Being a glass half full person, I try and find something positive in each and every day now, rather than dwelling on the past, or what may happen in the future.	OPINION
I do my research, am able to talk articulately to my doctors, and just so pleased to be alive, even with a somewhat curtailed lifestyle.	OPINION
Hope you get some relief soon for your symptoms - if I can help in any further way, just let me know.	OPINION

Hi again, just had a thought that may help you.	OPINION
When I was on FEC chemo for breast cancer, I was very sick (vomiting and diarrhea) and couldn't even eat a mouthful of home made vegetable soup with the solids strained out without rushing to the loo.	EXPERIENCE
My Oncologist prescribed a small daily dose of dexamethasone (a steroid) and got the hospital to send me a huge carton of Fortijuice - a vitamin and mineral juice type drink - 9 different flavours, all yucky, but I had to have some nourishment to stay alive.	EXPERIENCE
Each carton had 300 cals and I had to sip 3 cartons a day.	EXPERIENCE
Did the trick!	NOT_LABELED
I also had bad nausea, and found that any drink with ginger in it did quell it somewhat.	EXPERIENCE
I seemed to have drunk gallons of non alcoholic ginger beer (cloudy and fizzy) and ginger ale (clear and fizzy), plus the occasional treat of Stone's Green Ginger wine - slightly alcoholic, topped up with ice and ginger ale.	EXPERIENCE
These drinks stopped me from becoming dehydrated.	EXPERIENCE
I did lose some 28 lbs during the 4 months of FEC chemo, but have put it back on thankfully and am steady at 112 lbs.	EXPERIENCE
perfect for my small frame and height.	OPINION
Just a thought - many of my bc sisters have also found ginger very helpful in dealing with constant nausea.	OPINION

Liz, Thank you so much.	NOT_LABELED
Your comments prompted me to get myself to the dr.	FACT
I feel so much better.	EXPERIENCE
I am able to eat (with limitations) but I am holding my food down.	EXPERIENCE
I haven't had any vomiting and very little nausea.	EXPERIENCE
I am still have a lot of joint pain and I need to go see the doc again re: that symptom.	EXPERIENCE
Do you suggest any meds with little side effects.	OPINION
The doc gave me percocet for the pain but that isn't working so well.	EXPERIENCE
I didn't want to go the standard route of steroids to cure the flair up and thankfully the doc is treating my symptoms individually.	EXPERIENCE
I hope you are doing well, I'm so happy to have found a crohns friends with the same ""happy to be alive"" feeling that I have.	OPINION
I feel good on this forum being able to talk about my disease without feeling like I'm complaining.	OPINION
My husband says I never tell him when I'm not feeling well.	FACT
But I'm so happy to be on this earth with my children that I don't like to complain about my crohns.	OPINION
thanks for all the advice.	NOT_LABELED
Hi - good to hear you are feeling a tad better and eating a little.	OPINION
Not sure which meds you want advice on - I take, on rising, one codeine phosphate (helps with the lower abdomen pain), one imodium, to slow down the motility, one folic acid (necessary when taking methotrexate) and inject myself with 12.5mg of methotrexate weekly.	EXPERIENCE
(I take other meds for breast cancer and osteopenia).	EXPERIENCE
Mtx can be very toxic to the liver especially, but I have monthly blood tests and am tolerating it well.	EXPERIENCE
I don't feel I have side effects at all from mtx, but have had to stop my bc med, Arimidex, which has caused severe joint pains (hips,hands & feet).	EXPERIENCE
Stopped 4 weeks ago and the pain has diminished somewhat.	EXPERIENCE
Seeing GP 28th May for referral to a new Oncologist as mine retired last year.	FACT
You are right to steer clear of steroids.	OPINION
When I was dx in 1970, the dark ages as far as Crohn's was concerned, the only med to bring a flare into remission was prednisone, and the thinking then was it would keep one in remission, which has now been proven to be inaccurate.	EXPERIENCE
I was on steroids, varying amounts, for 30 yrs and this has played havoc with my bone density, which is classed osteopenic after various DEXA scans.	EXPERIENCE
I take alendronic acid (a bisphosphonate) weekly, and daily Calcichew/Vit.D to strengthen my bones and prevent further loss.	EXPERIENCE
Nobody told me all those years ago that steroids did this, perhaps they didn't know, but even if they had, there was no alternative to steroids.	EXPERIENCE
Happily, there are so many new drugs now for Crohn's, it seems to be a question of trial and error to find one that keeps you in remission.	OPINION
Guess I discovered the holy grail when I found mtx on the internet and badgered my then gastro to prescribe it off licence.	OPINION
It is still not licensed in England for Crohn's as the mfrs feel there are too few patients to make the licensing costs worthwhile.	FACT
Are you on an immuno-suppressant?	FACT
I remember some years ago when the Crohn's & Colitis Foundation of America (CCFA) had a website where questions were answered foc by a retired gastroenterologist, Dr. Eugene May.	FACT
That forum is now defunct, due to legal problems, diagnosing/prescribing over the net.	FACT
However, Dr. May did say that Crohn's patients should always be on an immuno-suppressant (like mtx), because the disease is incurable.	FACT
I have not had a flare since taking mtx, except for a bad one when having FEC chemo for breast cancer and had to stop the mtx.	EXPERIENCE
Take care Li - always happy to share my own experiences with you if I can help at all.	OPINION

Hi Liz, Hope you had a great weekend.	OPINION
Im in the same boat!!	FACT
I wake up vomiting and cant hold anything down.... When its that sever it lasts about 2 weeks and then I'll go down to 2-3 times a week.	EXPERIENCE
Even if i just have some water in the morning I might vomit.	EXPERIENCE
I'm currently on pentasa, and going to start predisone in July.	EXPERIENCE
Im VERY nervous.	OPINION
I rather vomit then go threw all the side effects I've heard of!!!	EXPERIENCE
But vomiting is affecting my daily life.	EXPERIENCE
I think its been about 5 days since I last threw up and thats the longest of gone since probably November.	EXPERIENCE
Now its coming out the other end (I think is worse) Im going any where from 4-10 times a day and its not nice!	EXPERIENCE
So I dont think theres much you can do.	OPINION
Its just living with crohns!!	OPINION
Ive tried changing how I eat and even that hasnt made a difference.	EXPERIENCE
If you find anything that helps please let me know!!	FACT
The Dr. gave me compazine for the vomiting.	EXPERIENCE
I helped but I had to stop taking it because it made my joints hurt too much.	EXPERIENCE
How are you doing on the prednisone?	FACT
I am a former patient of Dr may and I have a question I need to ask him is he still available?	FACT
I've had Crohn's for 18 years, and I've had my share of meds.	EXPERIENCE
Prednizone, Sulfasalazine (Azulfidine), and more recently ENTOCORT EC (a nonsystemic corticosteroid)- basically works like a steroid without going into the bloodstream, so it has very limited side effects.	EXPERIENCE
My Crohn's has always been upper track, especially in the stomach.	EXPERIENCE
If my stomach is upset with stress, booze, or too much acid I get horrible stomach pains and usually vomit and dont eat for several days.	EXPERIENCE
My health insurace decided to stop covering my medicine for heart burn, Protonix, they want me to use over the counter digestive band aides.	EXPERIENCE
This stresses me out, so I get sick.	EXPERIENCE
I also manage my Crohn's with Canabis.	EXPERIENCE
When I first started smoking, my major symptom-appetite loss all but disappeared.	EXPERIENCE
Then I was able to start looking at other supplements and how to treat Crohn's with better eating.	EXPERIENCE
No more red meat, especially red meat that is fed with corn- this means no fast food, no mystery meat!	FACT
I had an almost immediate health turn around after making this change.	EXPERIENCE
No more corn!	OPINION
Especially processed corn, it destroys your insides by throwing off the natural fatty acid balance.	OPINION
Supplement with fish oil to help with this.	OPINION
When your DR prescribes antibiotics, make sure to take Probiotics to increase healthy micro-flora.	OPINION

I am a 25 year old female.	FACT
I was diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis almost a year ago after having a bad attack after pizza one weekend that never went away.	EXPERIENCE
It took about 3 months of extreme pain, biopsys, barium tests, and a colonoscopy to find out what I was sick with.	EXPERIENCE
I spent 3 months off of work resting at home because I became so sick and malnourishment and too many trips to the bathroom to count.	EXPERIENCE
The pain I experienced was horrible.	EXPERIENCE
I would get bundled over with abdomal pain and just start crying in front of my customers due to the insane pain.	EXPERIENCE
I was put on my first treatment of ENTOCORT EC for 4 months along with Protonix for the heartburn, and another pill for the nausea.	EXPERIENCE
I was able to return to work after 3 months but was still feeling very ill.	EXPERIENCE
Its been almost a year and I am not healing as suspected so I am on my second round of treatment with Entocort and protonix.	EXPERIENCE
I am struggling to find out what my body can eat and what it cant.	EXPERIENCE
I am still throwing up a few days in a row in the mornings no matter what it is that I eat and It seems that when I start to feel ill it last about a week.	EXPERIENCE
Everyday is a different story and that is frustrating in itself.	OPINION
This has taken a toll on my normal cheery self and the steroids give me horrible side effects including: depression, insomnia, weight gain, sweats, nausea, etc.	EXPERIENCE
The depression is the worst, I feel very angry that at 24 years old I have been handed this card and I am not able to live the life of a normal 25 year old right now.	EXPERIENCE
Its going to take some time to get use to the idea but I believe everything happens for a reason and we arent given more than we can handle...most of the time.	OPINION
I wish the best of luck to everyone and Its not an easy journey but you are a stronger person for doing it.	OPINION
Begin by only eating brown rice and soy yogurt.	OPINION
Make a record of food that make you sick.	OPINION
Basil and many spice made me sick.	EXPERIENCE

Hi, my boyfriend got diagnosed with Crohn's disease last year and has been hospitalized around 6 times.	EXPERIENCE
He has been on a few different medications and all seem to do NOTHING.	EXPERIENCE
He has now been throwing for the last 2 days, trying to only eat what the Dr. told him (soup broth, ginger ale & crackers).	EXPERIENCE
The interesting thing is he isn't throwing up any food, its all acid & the last 2 days its been just about every 2 hours.	EXPERIENCE
He's taking 6mp right now & refuses to take the nausea meds cause it gives him a horrible migraine.	EXPERIENCE
Is there something the Dr. is missing, not giving him, or any other medications out there that work better in these cases?	OPINION
If so I would greatly appreciate some advice.	OPINION
Thank You!	NOT_LABELED
Hi All, I thought I would let some people know what my experiences were.	OPINION
I have Ulcerative colitis, and really from the start (3 - 4 years) i have had constant morning nausea.	EXPERIENCE
To be 100% honest, I get nausea and dry reaching / vommiting, but it is almost always when I get up, and before I eat, normally in the shower i have 5 - 10 mins of dry reaching.	EXPERIENCE
It is not effected by bowel movements, i.e I have not gone to the toilet or even after I still get it.	EXPERIENCE
I changed my meds from salfa to mesaline and that made a 10% difference, certainly not signifant but enough to offer a little relief.	EXPERIENCE
I have not found a solution to preventing something like this, and again being honest its something that I have almost gotten used to, its not something that I like to have to go through every morning, nor is it nice for my partner to listen to, but I certainly am getting used to it, and not eating before makes it a little easier, if i was to have breakfast then be sick, i would not be able to handle it, so I normally don't eat breakfast.	EXPERIENCE
Sorry its not a solution, rather another perspective.	OPINION

I had my colon removed in 2004 because of severe ulcerative colitis.	EXPERIENCE
My surgeon was able to perform a Restorative Proctocolectomy, so I have an internal J-Pouch.	EXPERIENCE
Life with the J-Pouch has been tons better than with the rogue colon, but it has never been 100%.	EXPERIENCE
My doctor and I have tried all kinds of medications to get it to calm down, Flagyl, Amitriptylin, Glycopyrrolate, Xiflaxin.	EXPERIENCE
The only thing that has seemed to help was Ciprofloxacn, which then stopped working after a time and now works again in combination with Tindamax.	EXPERIENCE
My surgeon would prefer me not to be continuously on two antibiotics and I would certainly prefer that too, but the alternative is not fun, cramping, constant bathroom visits and the worst is leakage at night.	EXPERIENCE
Does ANYONE have any remedies, natural therapies, a different medication to suggest, really anything?	OPINION
I have also tried a course of probiotics while not taking medication and my pouch just continued to get worse.	EXPERIENCE
Have they looked at your diet?	FACT
You may be eating too much fiber, sugar and/or spices.	OPINION
I've had my pouch for 15 years and definitely the first year or so was tough but I eventually got into the habit of eating bulking foods (oatmeal, marshmallows, apple sauce, meats, eggs) and avoided heavy fiber foods and spices.	EXPERIENCE
Eventually I've been able to eat anything but occasionally if I have too much spicy or too much salads or sugar I run into problems.	EXPERIENCE
I assume you take an anti-diarrheal?	FACT
Thank you for your response.	NOT_LABELED
Unfortunately, even when I had Ulcerative Colitis, diet never seemed to make a difference.	EXPERIENCE
However, I do avoid spicy foods because they do bring pain.	EXPERIENCE
As far as anti-diarrheals, I have tried Imodium, but it seemed to make me feel like I had a blockage or constipation, but maybe I was taking too many or something.	EXPERIENCE
Thank you for the thoughts; I'd definitely appreciate any more you might have.	OPINION

That's counterintuitive with the antibiotic, but they seem to strike a better balance that with the antibiotic alone.	EXPERIENCE
I have had j-pouch since 1991 and last few years have had very bad pouchitis overflow incontinence.	EXPERIENCE
Pouch nurse gave me a Medina cathater which is a tube with which you can empty the pouch.	EXPERIENCE

I have incontinence through out the night.	EXPERIENCE
Go to the bathroom at least 7-8 times a day.	EXPERIENCE
I use to be a runner but now can have no physical activity because of my incontinence and frequent bathroom stops.	EXPERIENCE
If I do anything physical or lift anything heavy I through myself into spasm which then require more morphine to manage my pain.	EXPERIENCE
I'm tired, depressed and scared to think this is my life.	EXPERIENCE
I have been seeing Dr. Bo Shen of the Cleveland Clinic who gives me alcohol and kenelog injections into the cuff of my J-pouch evert 6-months and at first this seemed to help with some of my pain and I was able to decrease my morphine intake.	EXPERIENCE

I had researched the ""bag"" and was not pleased with the results.	EXPERIENCE

I had a total proctocolectomy on 3/21/14 and life is getting better.	EXPERIENCE
The BCIR is similar to a Koch pouch with an improved valve design so there is no incontinence/leakage.	FACT

I was diagnosed with Chrons in 11/07.	EXPERIENCE
The only reason I am at this point is that in June 07 I began having wicked arthritis in my entire body.	EXPERIENCE
I could barely move, pick things up, etc.	EXPERIENCE
After many doctor visits, appointments with numerous specialists (including an RA specialist, after taking many ugly meds with bad side effects) I was sent to a GI and diagnosed with Chrons Colitis.	EXPERIENCE
He said that the arthritis is a direct side effect of the Chrons.	EXPERIENCE

Now I am being weened off of the steroids (it is painful and the arthritis flares up every now and then) and am on Imuran and am bouncing back.	EXPERIENCE

For around a year now I have been on infleximab by infusion, Methotrexate tablets as well as taking Questran to help digestion, folic acid and 3 monthly B12 injections.	EXPERIENCE
I have had some trouble over the years with stiff joints in my hands, mostly in winter, but around four months ago I started getting real pain in my hands and fingers followed by them swelling, this then started in my feet and ankles, legs, knees, arms elbows and shoulders and seems to move from one place to the other on a 2-3 day basis, it sometimes even changes from being severe to the point of not being able to use my hands to just a slight pain and completely moved to, say a knee or a foot over night.	EXPERIENCE
My only respite now is too many pain killers and complete rest, as soon as I work (I don't to anything too manual these days) or take exersize one or another, or several of my limbs will be extremely painfull or sore to touch very soon after.	EXPERIENCE
The pain is not confined to my joints, in fact there is not always pain in the joint, more around it and in cases up my arm or leg, more like, and it changes, tendon or muscle pain.	EXPERIENCE
Yesterday my ankle was swollen and painfull to move, enough to cause me to limp and my calf muscle felt as though I had a severe cramp in it every time I put my foot to the floor.	EXPERIENCE
The strangest thing is this continuing changing of the area that gives most pain.	OPINION
I am coming to the end of my tether with this, my Doctors keep telling me its to do with the Crohns, we will have to do more tests etc.etc.	OPINION
My Crohns has been very good as far as I am concerned for some time now, although I have recently had a pillcam which seems to reveal that the Crohns is active but there is nowhere to go medically, looking like the only option is more surgery.	FACT
If the surgery would get rid of the new symptoms while the Crohns stays at bay, great but I am now 54 and not keen on yet more surgery when I feel in myself that this is a seperate issue from the Crohns.	OPINION
There are apparently more than 70 kinds of arthuritis, is it possible that this has nothing to do with the Crohns and should be investigated on its own symptoms?	OPINION
I find if you have Crohns any other ailment at all is lumped in with it, ""Oh that's to do with your Crohns"" is sometimes a very convenient answer.	OPINION

Plus I am on Entocort.	EXPERIENCE
I am slowly getting better.	EXPERIENCE
My ""urgency"" to go it all but gone now.	EXPERIENCE
But during my 2 year flare, My joints did not hurt!	EXPERIENCE
Now that the flare is under control, I am starting to hurt again.	EXPERIENCE
I tried jogging 3 weeks ago and that really got my shoulders and elbows hurting.	EXPERIENCE
Apparently from the bouncing motion.	OPINION
Anyway It seems that there is an infection in me that is either in my colon or in my joints but not at the same time!	OPINION
I don't like taking Tylenol all the time.	OPINION
I take a half of a Lorcet when it really hurts.	EXPERIENCE
Anyway I just wanted to post ""my"" situation for anyone else who may have similar problems.	FACT
Hopefully ""if it doesn't kill us, it will make us stronger"".	OPINION
And please , anyone else reading these posts, do the rest of us a favor and post your ""problems"".	OPINION
Until I read about Colitis Arthritis, I thought I was NUTS!	OPINION
Wow I am so happy to read all these postings I was just notified that I was misdiagnosed and I never had Ulcerative Colits I have always had Chrons Disease.	EXPERIENCE
I am now addicted to Codeine Sulfate.	EXPERIENCE
I was given that to keep my bowels thicker.	EXPERIENCE
I have seen many GI doctors and I think they just love to write prescriptions to keep you quite.	OPINION
When I get down to pick something up it takes me forever to get back up my knees hurt so BAD.	EXPERIENCE
My arm and hand go numb and I have constant back pain.	EXPERIENCE
They think the back pain is from all the fistulas I now have.	EXPERIENCE
Before they diagnosed me with Chrons I was scheduled to go in for surgery on March 30th to make my ostomy bag forever.	EXPERIENCE
Now with me being diagnosed with Chrons not sure about the surgery but the dr still wants to do it.	EXPERIENCE
They now want to put me on all types of Chrons medicine.	EXPERIENCE
I am frustrated and so upset this has happened to me.	EXPERIENCE
Hi, I'm a 45 yr old woman who was diagnosed with Crohn's about 7 years ago but I definately had it for some time before that.	EXPERIENCE
I have also dealt with back pain for the last 20 years and have always dealt with it via chiro, acupuncture, massage, physio, swimming etc.	EXPERIENCE
but in the last 6 months I've had some episodes that have been the most painful of my life and have only recently been told that the two are likely related.	EXPERIENCE
I've been on Humira for 2 yrs, infliximab I reacted badly too, and colazide gives me diarhea, and the sulfasalizine type drugs just do bugger all.	EXPERIENCE
I want to only to say I empathise with you all.	FACT
To others we look like we're okay, it's hard for them to understand the excrutiating pain we can be in.	OPINION
And I'm relieved to discover there is a connection between the two.	OPINION
Along with humira (and now celebrex) I take cod liver oil, spirulina, pro biotics, zinc, magnesium orotate.	EXPERIENCE
I make sure I eat lots of healthy, grass fed red meat and well cooked vegetables.	EXPERIENCE
Don't fall for the 'raw is best' line, hard enough for any body to absorb nutrients from raw veg without a rumen let alone us with absorprtion problems.	OPINION
Good luck all.	NOT_LABELED
I was diagnosed w Crohns Disease at age 30 (which was 5 years ago).	EXPERIENCE
I am about 15 to 20lbs overweight...	FACT
so i could stand to lose weight.	OPINION
My symptoms aren't necessarily all typical from what I've been told.	EXPERIENCE
I suffer from flare ups consisting of mild constipation, moderate abdominal cramps, & occasional nausea.	EXPERIENCE
My worse symptom by far is extreme Joint Pain.	EXPERIENCE
I do not have RA or arthritis according to my MD.	EXPERIENCE
She tells me that it the pain is directly related to what is happening with my colon.	EXPERIENCE
I have significant narrowing in the last part of my small intestine & acscending colon.	EXPERIENCE
I'm told that it is time for surgical intervention.	EXPERIENCE
But I'm very scared & have put it off for 5 months now... entocort / pentasa combo doesn't help & the MD said no need to try other drugs at this point...have surgery.	EXPERIENCE
Would love to know if removal of narrowed colon would help ease joint pain...	OPINION
Most nights I'm soaking in HOT baths & taking pain meds trying to get relief.	EXPERIENCE
It's miserable.	OPINION
Very little sleep.	FACT
Glad to hear I'm not crazy.	OPINION
The joint pain moves around - hands, knees, ankles, shoulders, etc.	EXPERIENCE
Never know where it will be next.	FACT
Any suggestions on full lapro procedure vs open?	FACT
I'd have to travel to have the lapro surgical method but thinking it would be worth it..	OPINION

I'm a 51 yr old female diagonsed with Crohns last summer.	EXPERIENCE
Prior to that I have had bathroom issues for several years.	EXPERIENCE
Within the last 4 yrs I had rt shoulder surgery, but the pain is horrible.	EXPERIENCE
The pain starts under rt shoulder blade, radiates down rt side of back and rt side, under rt rib cage, rt abdomen, rt arm and wrist very week and even makes my rt breast hurt.	EXPERIENCE
I've tried several meds nothing seems to help.	EXPERIENCE
It seems like the only time I can really get relief is when I've been admitted to hospital (twice) and they pour on the fluids, however short term.	EXPERIENCE
I thought I was CRAZY.	OPINION
I have a appt with Gastro shortly.	FACT
Hopefully they can help with all this crazy pain.	OPINION
Wow.	NOT_LABELED
I read this discussion and it could have been parts of my own life!!!	OPINION
I was diagnosed with crohns 17 years ago when I was 19.	EXPERIENCE
Spent the first 12 years having the digestive issues most of you guys described, including about a foot of bowel removed (iliem area) when I was 28.	EXPERIENCE
For the last 6 years it's been less digestive issues, though they are still there, and more joint issues.	EXPERIENCE
I have 3 vertebrae in my lower back that a back doc told me look like a 90 year old ditch digger's because of the amount of inflammation/arthritis affecting them.	EXPERIENCE
My knees, wrists, feet, toes, hips ...All can and will ache depending on the day/ moment.	EXPERIENCE
I have plantar facitis (sp)- inflamed tendons on the bottom of my feet, supposed gout in my left big toe - but it's ALL inflammation of 1 type or another.	EXPERIENCE
I'm taking hydromorphcontin every day wondering if I'm getting physically dependent on it, but not able to walk properly or ""manage my life"" if I don't take it.	EXPERIENCE
ie. Too stiff & sore & in too much pain to do simple things like cook, clean, go to the playground with my son (6 yrs old).	EXPERIENCE
I also have a spouse who tells me my pain is mostly ""in my head"" & I don't need the pain meds.	EXPERIENCE
I don't get a ""high"" from them, take them exactly as prescribed and have stopped taking them only to be unable to sleep & go from bed, straight to sofa in the morning because I'm to stiff & sore & in pain to do anything.	EXPERIENCE
I've met people with ""regular"" arthritis (reumatiod & osteo) and generally the people I've met say they suffer more from stiffnes & with RA deformaties but don't appear to have the ""traveling"" inflammation of the joints I do (as in one day my knees are worse, few days later it seems my wrists are worse, my back always hurts).	EXPERIENCE
Has any one else run into this?	FACT
I believe I have a very high pain tolerance lol after crohns for this long I've only been on regular pain meds for the last 4 years.	OPINION
With the gut pain we can get people with crohns develop a high pain tolerance I believe.	OPINION
I've tried humira but reacted to it.	EXPERIENCE
I also tried remicade a few years ago but had to stop because I got really run down & sick & couldn't get healthly again.	EXPERIENCE
My gastrio-doc is thinking of remicade again or referring me to a reumatiod arthritis doc, waiting for blood work to come back.	EXPERIENCE
In addition to humira (allerigic), remicade, I've been on pentasa, salofalk (sp?), entocort & prednisone, (so sick of cortisteroids), & immurane ( got very very sick from).	EXPERIENCE
Anyway not that I wish these problems on anyone but it is nice to hear about them & know a person isn't the only one going through it, especially when (for me at least) the people closest to me really have no idea what it's like.	OPINION
Thanks for letting me ramble.	NOT_LABELED
Hi, I was diagnosed with crohns disease in 2003, I had one colon resection in 2006.	EXPERIENCE
I am in pain everyday, and I too think that I am crazy, and would not ever wish this debilitating disease on no one.	EXPERIENCE
I am always reading to find out more about this disease.	FACT
I change my diet from time to time, but it is never the same.	EXPERIENCE
What I ate last week, I can not eat this week.	EXPERIENCE
I get sick just thinking about what to eat and what not to eat.	EXPERIENCE
I have taken Asacol, Imuran, prednisone, entocort, and the list goes on.	EXPERIENCE
I try to pray daily, but my mind is so much on the pain, I forget to sometimes.	EXPERIENCE
I ache through out my whole body daily, I go through the pain and every other night I take a vicodin to help me sleep.	EXPERIENCE
(do not want to become addicted) tylenol nor tylenol PM works for me anymore.	EXPERIENCE
I have Rheumatoid arthritis stemming from the crohns.	FACT
Sometime I do not even know what to say or how to describe my pain anymore, because it just seems as though people do not believe you, and I guess because I still have to get up and do what I have to do; cook, clean, wash, drive kids, which is dangerous because my legs sometimes lock up on me and I have to pull over until the pain goes away.	EXPERIENCE
I feel for everyone on this panel and I understand the misery of Crohns, we are not CRAZY, just in constant PAIN.	OPINION
Hi, I am back, (Nace1) my first post was June 7th 2010, where I spoke about having had Crohn's for some 26/7 years, 3 Ops, (bowel resections) and at date of that post 4 months of severe migrating joint pain.	EXPERIENCE
So here we are 14 months later with an update: Many consultations later with both Gastro & Reumatologist, Reumo is baffled by what is going on as many tests show no degradation associated with arthritis but believes in my pain and has seen physical and photographic evidence of swellings	EXPERIENCE
In summary thinks its connected to the Crohn's, somehow?	OPINION
Gastro is convinced the Crohn's is under control and therefore joint & other area's with these symptoms are not connected ?	EXPERIENCE
so, not the Crohn's?	EXPERIENCE
So neither of them are taking any responsibility, they cant both be right unless it is something completely different?	OPINION
I am so so frustrated, I am sure I could handle the pain and disability better if I new what it is and what to expect, I am now unable to work full time or plan anything as I don't know from one day to the next how I am going to be.	OPINION
I don't know the answers, but it does help to speak with people who have an idea what I am going through, so thanks for that at least guys, actually I think mostly ladies on this forum, I feel for you all.	OPINION
Paul.	NOT_LABELED
Hi, Yes, it's probably all related, because Crohn's and arthritis are both auto-immune conditions, where the body's immune system attacks the body itself.	OPINION
I did it the other way round, I've had arthritis for many years, since my 30s (I'm now 61) and I got Crohn's at age 54.	EXPERIENCE
It was blamed on the anti-inflammatory drugs I had been taking for years.	EXPERIENCE
I have especially bad arthritis in my spine and can't now take much in the way of anti-inflammatory, only 1 tab of naproxen a day, but it does take the edge off.	EXPERIENCE
What's really good for joints is green-lipped mussel supplement, freely available.	OPINION
I got on to it because the vet gave one of our dogs some for hip arthritis and within a couple of days she was jumping round like a puppy, so I thought if it works for the dog, it's gotta help me too!	EXPERIENCE
Give that a try, it doesn't seem to irritate the gut.	OPINION
Hey this i think is defiantly crohn's related...	OPINION
I'm a 30 yr old female who was diagnosed with Crohn's earlier this year & also diagnosed with Psoriatic Arthritis a few months ago.	EXPERIENCE
I'm in pain all the time & it *****, i know how it feels...	EXPERIENCE
I too also have to go see a Reumatologist for the Psoriatic Arthritis & i'm taking Embrel Shots 2x a week for it cause i have plaque masses on my hands, elbows, knees, back & the whole top of my right foot & those are all the places i also have joint pain too :( They itch all the time, they are red & swollen but i not only do i feel the pain on the outside of my skin, i feel it in my joints too.	EXPERIENCE
Hi I have Crohns disease and have just started getting alot of joint pain , mainly in my right hip , its so bad some times i am unable to weight bare on it , Any advice ?	EXPERIENCE
Well like the most of you I've been on this roller coaster for 18 years now with Colitis, my hips and knees were getting so sore I was having trouble trying to sleep.	EXPERIENCE
After feeling my GI was enjoying his work just a little too much and feeling embarrassed to go for appointments I switched to a new GI who after five years has never given me a rectal exam in his office.	EXPERIENCE
He put me on 300 mg of Celebrix/ day and after one month the only time my hips bother me is if I walk further than I should and yes definitely related to Chron's and Colitis.	EXPERIENCE
Now there are two different dosages depending on which Arthritis your GI puts down you are being treated for, the milder sorry if that sounds insensitive only allows 200 mg for insurance purposes where the nastier form allows for 400 mg.	FACT
I'm sorry I haven't got the names I know one is Rumathoid but I think you should get the idea.	FACT
so my GI gives me 300 mg because 200 wouldn't do it.	EXPERIENCE
Good Luck to you all and may God Bless.	NOT_LABELED

Trina is that what it's called  green-lipped mussel supplement, from what I know Celebrex is better than Naproxin and doesn't bother me at all at 300 mg / day, my hips and knees have finally stopped bothering me.	EXPERIENCE
My Colitis has been contributed to my anti inflamatory Feldene 200 mg / day I was taking following three failed back surgeries.	EXPERIENCE
Strange they gave me the good old reliable strong one and really messed me up.	OPINION
It's funny our pets get better meds than we do.	OPINION
I just want to make sure of the name of the other, they won't give my wife the same as me so she still suffers, maybe it will work for her too Thank in advance.	OPINION

Hi, I was diagnosed with UC in 2007 and have had a couple bad flares, bad enough to be hospitalized for.	EXPERIENCE
I have seen major improvement in my digestion since I started the Specific Carbohydrate Diet (SCD) via Elaine Gottshalls book Breaking the Vicious Cycle.	EXPERIENCE
I still have some joint pains buy they seem to be improving.	EXPERIENCE
Epsom salts baths add some relief.	EXPERIENCE

I was diagnosed with UC 15 years ago that never went into remission and I had a colectomy with j-pouch surgery 13 years ago.	EXPERIENCE
That took care of the intestinal issues, but I have had fatigue and joint/muscle aches all along the way and they have recently gotten worse.	EXPERIENCE
The slightest exertion can leave me achy, weak, nauseous, and blurred vision for 1-3 days after.	EXPERIENCE
Usually I'm battling fatigue and aches on a regular basis, but it gets a lot worse after any exertion.	EXPERIENCE
All blood work comes back normal.	EXPERIENCE
Doctor has me on fish oil and anti-depressants.	EXPERIENCE

Feeling pretty hopeless but plan to try arthritis medicine like Celebrex if doc agrees.	OPINION
Your symptoms are the same as mine.	FACT
My bowels are in remission, but I suffer with fistulas.	EXPERIENCE
I have been having the same arthritis symptoms for the past year, severe.	EXPERIENCE
Moves from joint to joint severely every day.	EXPERIENCE
Every joint, from my toes, feet, ankles, knees, shoulders, elbows,wrists, fingers.	EXPERIENCE
It seems to be leaving me with nerve damage.	EXPERIENCE
Now have numbness below one knee and all fingers in left hand.	EXPERIENCE
My right hand has nerves pinching currently and unable to straighten my finger.	EXPERIENCE
Also affects my tendons.	EXPERIENCE
I also feel it must be more than just arthritis.	OPINION
I am only 50 and feel I will have to get on disability soon if I don't get this under control.	OPINION

Did you ever get a doctors response?	FACT
Try eliminating sugars / Doing so saved my joints.	OPINION
I'm in my 30's and I've had moderate / sever ulcerative colitis for 9 years and about 2 or 3 years after my first symptoms I started experiencing severe joint pain that would migrate from joint to joint (knees, knuckles, shoulders, toes, ankles, inner hip/groin, as well as in my back and chest muscles.	EXPERIENCE
The pain would last severely in one joint/area for a 1-4 days often being debilitating (sleepless nights, extreme pain, inability to use joint, sometimes, hot swollen joint) then would travel to another joint usually then travel to the other or go dormant for a time then flair up again.	EXPERIENCE
After almost giving up on trying to fix the problem I saw a pattern (a few days after gorging on Halloween candy) that the flairs were directly associated with my consumption of processed sugars.	EXPERIENCE
It was amazing after cutting candy, soda, and high fructose corn syrup and other processed sugars out of my diet for about a month the joint pain stopped completely.	EXPERIENCE
I found can eat natural sugars no problem such as in fruit and juice and have no problem.	EXPERIENCE
Once again the pain literally stopped after about a month and hasn't returned for now years.	EXPERIENCE
However, if I stray and start to each too much processed sugars I can feel it creeping in once in full force for a time after straying from my strict no sugar rule).	EXPERIENCE
Those little reminders and one large reminder have allowed me to stay ""bad"" sugar free and pain free.	EXPERIENCE
Before when I had the pain I used high and low doses of prednizone but even prednizone didn't completely help me.	EXPERIENCE
It wasn't until I stopped the sugar and stayed off it that I found relief.	EXPERIENCE
Also, I've been able to stay predizone free as well).	EXPERIENCE
Although my colitis is still an issue (mostly managed by Asocal / Asathiaprine) the joint pain is past.	EXPERIENCE
I hope this helps and I highly recommend you try this as it saved me so much pain.	OPINION
On a related note I also try to stay away from too much fake sugars (diet drinks, etc) as I have found that these have caused me some trouble although not nearly as much as processed sugars.	EXPERIENCE
Good luck!!!	NOT_LABELED

I am the type of person who is also a worrier and a stresshead at times, so I don't know whether it's to do with that as well.	OPINION
Anyway it would be great if you could let me know.	OPINION
Ask for a hormone test.	OPINION
Your hair loss doesn't have to be a part of the UC.	OPINION
In any case patchy hair loss is a symptom that should be looked into.	OPINION
I am a hairdresser and I have noticed that women with UC because of lack of nutrion lose Can have hair loss.	EXPERIENCE
You don't absorb enough vitiamns.	FACT
So you might want to take some.	OPINION
Also it could be hormones like was suggested or it could be a thyroid problem.	OPINION
If you are stressed alot its likely to be that also.	OPINION
When you get stressed your scalp tightens up and it cuts the circulation off to the hair follicals and your hair can get dry and brittle.	FACT
so stimulation to the scalp helps hair growth and health.	FACT
You might have some blood work next time you go to the doctor just to rule out all the other stuff mentioned.	OPINION

However, I have just started to notice what you mention.	EXPERIENCE
Widening part, small bald patch at the crown.	EXPERIENCE
This does concern me!	OPINION
I think vitamin supplements are worth starting and will do that right away.	OPINION
I have also read articles about lack of iron leading to hair loss - but don't you think my twice daily iron supplement would prevent this?	OPINION

I have had chronic hair loss in the same pattern(i feel like i have little bald devil horns and im going to need a wig soon!) and have also always had TONS of hair and stress so I did iron/multvitamin and other vitamin regimens for the last 2 years straight,it has not helped my hair one bit.	EXPERIENCE
I have tried being on anti-anxiety/anti-depressants to see if the lack of stress would help,1 year on those,no help at all.	EXPERIENCE
Now my eyebrows are starting to go rapidly,the entire hair loss thing came on suddenly and like WiLdFiRe!	EXPERIENCE
Multiple Dr's say they have no clue,a friend suggested I go see a Dermatologist,I don't *think* ive ever done a hormone test or if that'd even provide a solution.I don't want to go bald and then find out what's wrong and then be told it's too late to really grow any of the hair back because of how long it's been happening for.Ya know?

Hi, I was diagnosed with UC over a year ago, and have gone through a plethora of different drugs to find something which works (relatively...), among which Asacol and Prednisone, both of which are having a huge effect on my hair - that is I lose quite a lot.	EXPERIENCE
I am quite young (22) so it has nothing to do with hormones etc.	EXPERIENCE
My physician told me it was mostly stress (yes, like this is gonna help...anyone with UC knows how stress is hard to control when you're sick and bothered about it!), but my hairdresser aunt actually gave me a great tip - Zinc!	OPINION
Generally I find that taking multi-vitamins help me, if only because I know with my bowel habits I don't absorb enough vitamins, but Zinc had a great effect on my hair.	EXPERIENCE
It is growing again so I am starting to get some thickness back, though I have illusions that it will be back to how it was before.	EXPERIENCE
Anyway, I took Zinc, 50mg tablets once a day, and in 1 week I felt a difference, and I stopped taking it and the hair still doesn't go off.	EXPERIENCE
It is worth a try at the very least then!	OPINION
I have uc for 2 years i took the same medication for 45 days only, since then I have thin and dry hair.	EXPERIENCE

Switched to Sulfasalazine and the hair loss stopped, but in the last couple months started losing hair again and have a bald patch on the back of my head.	EXPERIENCE
I'm 25 and this is NOT a side effect of sulfasalazine, so I guess this is just what many uc sufferers have to deal with.	OPINION
made a dr. appt just in case though.	FACT
So sorry for eveyone's troubles, wish you all the best.	OPINION
Hair loss is a side effect from Mesalamine, which is an NSAID (non-steroid anti inflammatory).	FACT
Treatment with NSAID's creates a shock to your system which transforms hairs in the growing stage to the dormant stage (for a few months) and then the shedding stage.	FACT
This is why you don't see the shedding until a few months in.	FACT
The damage is done when the hair is rendered dormant, but the shedding that follows takes a few months.	FACT
Do some research on NSAID's and hair loss.	OPINION
I am a 31-year-old woman who has had U.C. for three years.	EXPERIENCE
I was taking my regular (doctor recommended) vitamins: fish oil, calcium, vitamin D, vitamin C, magnesium; and stopped taking them because I was tired of taking so many pills every day, along with Asacol.	EXPERIENCE
Soon I developed severe pneumonia, was in the hospital for two weeks, had lots of chest x-rays, and my hair began just dropping out.	EXPERIENCE
Then the remaining hairs were quite thin and showed a piment-less stripe all around.	EXPERIENCE
The stripe makes it easy to see how far my hair has grown in a year -- 3.5”, compared to the normal 6”.	EXPERIENCE
As soon as I went back on my vitamins, the hair loss desisted and the lost hairs began growing back right away.	EXPERIENCE
In other words, take vitamins!	OPINION
And if your U.C. is still not under control, ask your doctor about stepping up your treatment to a medication like Imuran (Azathioprine), an immunosuppressant, and go to a bowel disease specialist.	OPINION
Taking these steps has turned my life around – I feel better than I have in three years!	EXPERIENCE
Just don’t skip doses.	FACT
Do you know if the hair loss just a temporaray side effect from the mesalamine?	FACT
I'm taking it(Lialda) and noticed my hair really shedding now the past week or two.	EXPERIENCE
I've been on the Lialda for about 4 months.	EXPERIENCE
I hope it's not permanent.	OPINION
I would suggest assisting your circulation with L-argimine and ginkgo biloba.	OPINION
I have Celiac disease, so I also have absorptive problems.	EXPERIENCE
I take lots of vitamins and minerals and eat gluten-free and eat healthy.	EXPERIENCE
But adding these two aids to circulation has me looking great (skin).	EXPERIENCE
So between those and adding a shower water filter to take out both chlorine and chloramine that my city adds to the water, my skin and hair are optimized.	EXPERIENCE
My hair looks healthy and fuller, although it's only been a few weeks.	EXPERIENCE
Lialda nd any other type of mesalamine do not cause hair loss.	FACT
Steroids and malnutrition do.	FACT
Yes, Mesalamine, Lialda, Asacol etc., do not correlate with hair loss.	FACT
Prednisone, Cortisone, etc. and stress do.	FACT
It can be either and at 7, I would ask a doctor.	OPINION
Take vitamins.	OPINION
It was only a matter of time and not your medicine.	OPINION
Has anyone experienced hair loss with using 6mp for UC.	FACT
I've been on it for 2 months and noticed hair loss in the last three weeks.	EXPERIENCE
Does this ever stop?	FACT
