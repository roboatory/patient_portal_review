I don't think it's the caffeine, but one way you can figure out if it's caffeine is to try black or green tea (both are from the same plant).  Just be mindful that the green tea can still carry a problem with lead from the processing.  Dr. Mercola has articles that explain this more thoroughly.  There are some that he explains don't have this risk.  I know it seems like there shouldn't be a risk, since they are steaming, then drying to keep the leaves green.  So, I'm not sure where the lead comes from.  But, black tea doesn't carry the same risk.  I myself simply can't drink tea, though, because the tannin bothers me.\"\n",

I also have a diagnosis of Herpes simplex 2 and recently the episodes of IBS have increased as a result of my period, as have the herpes epsiodes- is there a direct link with herpes and IBS/Crohns and if so if I were to treat the herpes would this improve my bowel symptoms. Thanks', 'I have the same problem, but from the information I have gathered is that herpes flare ups happen when our bodies are under stress. I have to say having to go to the potty 5 to 7 times a day canker sores stomach cramps alternating constipation and loose/soft stools are very stressful .if I find out anything different I will be sure to share please do the same I would love to know of any connection', 'I think mine is type 1 I get them on my face', 'On your face is herpes simplex1, in the genitalia it is herpes simplex 2.\\n\\nI too have Crohn\\'s and have \"cold sores\" - herpes simplex1\\n\\nI have only once or twice had a breakout while also severely ill and in the hospital from the disease.\\n\\nI see no direct link to the illness except that as emg454 mentioned, herpes reacts to stress.\\nWhen you are in a \"major\" flare up verses the everyday things that come with this illness, and anything else in your life that can be compounding the \"stress situation\" ie..family, kids, work, fear of losing job/medical benefits, possible surgery, ect... it all adds to the stress your body is under while trying to fend off the attack on our immune systems, therefore you could be susceptible to further outbreaks.   Hope this helps some.\\nKim', \"I just started a treatment regimen for the herpes i have cold sores.  My doctor is doing a medical study to see if this medicine will work.  He put me on acyclovir 800 mg 2 times a day and 15mg of meloxicam 1 x a day and gave me a sample pack of a pain medicine I can't remember the name of it.  This is a surgeon in my area he is a very good doctor.  He says my cold sores and my stress are directly related to my severe stomach/abdominal pain.  I had gastric bypass surgery last June 2011 before this I never had much stomach pain or cold sores.\", 'I WANT TO KNOW CAN HERPES TYPE 2 BOTHER YOUR IBS?', \"I have been in a world of pain and discomfort for about a year now.

Take care.\", 'Hey guys, if you have any questions that still need answers please post a new question so we can help you out. \\n\\n\\nThank you!', 'Hi Guys,\\n\\nI see this is a really old thread, but I want to share the info I have on this matter as it \\'s a top very close to my heart and I want to help anyone I can who is also struggling with these health issues...\\n\\nI have struggled with IBS-C since I was a little girl, and contracted HSV2 about 5 years ago. I have dealt with weekly, if not daily, herpes outbreaks since my contracting it. I found when my gut acted up (pain, distention, bloating, constipation etc), I would get an outbreak within hours. Even taking Valtex at 1G per day didn\\'t stop it. I work out regularly, eat a whole foods diet and have seen a therapist regularly to manage stress. Nothing helped, if anything it got worse over the years. \\n\\nI have only recently, in the past year, found out that the underlying cause of IBS is often a condition called SIBO (small intestinal bacteria overgrowth). This is when bacteria that is only meant to be in the large intestine makes its way up in to the small intestine. This can cause damage to the mucosal lining of the small intestine as well as create gas, blasting, constipation, diarrhea, food intolerances, chronic fatigue etc. The reason this happens is due to low stomach acid, pancreatic exocrine function, and/or malfunctioning ileocecal valve.Bascially stress from emotions, food, drugs (recreational or pharma) all contribute to this problem.\\n\\nThe overgrowth of bacteria in the small intestine leads to a lot of endotoxins (waste) from the bacteria. This waste damages the nerves surrounding in the gut leading to issues with motility (constipation, diarrhea), and weakens the immune system. This is what lead to an opportunity for the herpes virus to express itself in me regularly. It took me years to find this out. I thought I was being punished and was always going to have this health situation, but luckily, I don\\'t.\\n\\nTo heal SIBO, you need to have a doctor or nutritionist supervise and provide a healing protocol via a diet called \\'Low FODMAP\", and one, to several rounds of either pharmaceutical or herbal antibiotics to rebalance the microbiome. The low FODMAP\\'s diet will reduce inflammation and help to starve the bacteria. Most find a huge relief in symptoms from cutting out high FODMAP foods alone, but that\\'s only half the battle. You need the anti-microbials and re-inocculation.\\n\\nTesting for SIBO is key. You can do so through a Naturopath or Nutritionist. It\\'s important to know you have it for sure. Keep in mind, studies are now proving that SIBO is the underlying case of IBS, and can be cured with patience and diligence. \\n\\nSo, the link between IBS and herpes is real. IBS/SIBO severely weakens the immune system and creates the space of the virus to wreak havoc. When you get the gut micrbiome under control, the virus will not have the same opportunities to express itself. \\n\\nI really hope this helps many of you struggling with this. I know it can seem like a hopeless issue and if I can add any other energy to this I\\'d say; please take self-judgement out of the mix. I know, easier said than done but at the end of the day it\\'s just a virus. It doesn\\'t define us. Self-judgment will only lead to more stress and we don\\'t need more of that. And there is someone out there that will fully accept you the way you are. I promise you that. Stay positive, full of optimism and self-love and don\\'t settle. You can heal these issues. \\n\\nxo']\n",
