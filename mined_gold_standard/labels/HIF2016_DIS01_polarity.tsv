hi, my doctor has come to the conclusion i have IBS after not showing any signs of chrons in a colonoscopy test .	NEGATIVE
I have every symptom of chrons however: Ab pain, bowel changes, bloating, pain, have had red eyes, sore on leg that change colour when fading, mouth ulcers, etc	NEGATIVE
my question is has anyone been diagnosed with chrons after having a clear colonoscpy?	NEUTRAL
Sorry ma'am but I was diagnosed with it after my bloodwork, colonoscopy and biopsies came back positive.	NEUTRAL
Most people I have talked to that have Chrons also had the positive colonoscopy's which sealed the deal.	NEUTRAL
Sorry.	NOT_LABELED
It is possible you have Crohn's in the small intestine, which will not show on a colonoscopy, as this only looks at the large intestine (colon).	NEUTRAL
An upper endoscopy (to look at the oesophagus, stomach and small intestine) is another test to rule out Crohn's as biopsies can be taken of the tissue during the procedure.	NEUTRAL
Crohn's often starts around the terminal ileum (next to the appendix) and can progress to the whole GI tract (mouth to anus), as mine has done.	NEUTRAL
A barium swallow through is another test to see any problems in the upper GI tract, but this is purely imaging, and biopsies cannot not be taken.	NEUTRAL
As far as I understand, the only conclusive proof of Crohn's is biopsy of affected tissue, looked at by a pathologist.	NEUTRAL
IBS is a diagnosis of exclusion - after all available tests are completed and found negative for Crohn's or Ulcerative Colitis.	NEUTRAL
It is not an IBD auto-immune disease and in my opinion, a lazy diagnosis by doctors who cannot be bothered to do proper evaluations.	NEGATIVE
Have you been tested for coeliac disease, as this can have similar symptoms to IBD?	NEUTRAL
Liz.	NOT_LABELED
I had something simular happen.	NEUTRAL
I had surgery in August to remove a mass in my small intestine, in the terminal ileum and they biopsy said high probability of Crohns.	NEGATIVE
However, when I had a colonoscopy and endoscopy 5 months later, it showed inflamation.	NEGATIVE
and ulcers throughout my small intestine but this time negative on the Crohns.	NEGATIVE
I don't really understand.	NEGATIVE
The doctor said I could still have it but been in remission during that time.	NEUTRAL
That makes no sense to me.	NEGATIVE
So we still don't know if I have it or not.	NEUTRAL
I've had biopsy that said yes and one that said no, I guess.	NEUTRAL
It just doesn't make sense to me.	NEGATIVE
Still, the prescription is the same whether I have it or not, steriods to clear up the ulcers and inflamation.	NEUTRAL
I'm taking Entocort and Nexium.	NEUTRAL
The doctor told me as long as I'm still feeling pretty good by this Summer then won't need to see him again unless I get symptoms again.	POSITIVE
He told me that doctor's are reluctant to diagnose Crohns unless they know definately it is Crohns because of insurance reasons.	NEGATIVE
I guess I can understand that.	NEUTRAL
Still, I'd like to know if I have Crohns or if it's something else, what is it?	NEUTRAL
You know?	NOT_LABELED
I hope you get a diagnosis soon.	POSITIVE
I can understand your frustration.	NEGATIVE
I wish you well.	POSITIVE
Take care.	NOT_LABELED
thankyou both for your informative replies...	POSITIVE
I have heard of people who have chrons in the small intestines ...	NEUTRAL
however when i asked my doctor whether or not this could be a possibility, he said if i had chrons it more than likely would have shown up in the bowel/colon and didnt want to talk any further.	NEUTRAL
i feel very frustrated as i have looked into many chrons symptoms from people with chrons and have been through everything they have ..	NEGATIVE
i was overwhelmed to finally find someone else going through what i have...	NOT_LABELED
i share your opinion of IBS being a lazy diognosis from a doctor ...	NEGATIVE
i just dont think you can be as sick as i've been and it be that...	NEGATIVE
and do you have to be having an attack of chrons for the colonoscopy/ endoscopy to pick up a positive result ...	NEUTRAL
or can it be picked up when youre not showing any symptoms?	NEUTRAL
....sounds like Aprils question!	NEUTRAL
anyway ,isn't it just great when you get better..	POSITIVE
have had 5 weeks of hell and am now feeling normal again!	POSITIVE
how are you girls feeling ?	NEUTRAL
good to talk...	POSITIVE
thanks for listening, ....saradan.	POSITIVE

Ok I know I said it wrong, but for the last 2 woman who posted, I was reading that there are 5 different Crohns, not sure of all but remember the most common was the ilieum, then lg intestines, then beggining of sm.	NEUTRAL
intestines the duednum, from mouth to anus.	NEUTRAL
and in some the jejelum,(where they can see with the endo capsule camera, but not with regular endoscope or colonoscope??	NEUTRAL
I was wondering abt this myself??	NEUTRAL
Any responses at the jejelum would be appreciated.	POSITIVE
Thanx,georgie.	NOT_LABELED
You can have Crohn's Disease anywhere in your digestive tract, from your lips to your anus.	NEUTRAL
It is most common in the colon, but it isn't exclusive.	NEUTRAL
Think of it as a mean thing living inside of you that can either attack one place or spread to another place, or MOVE to another.	NEGATIVE
This is why patients who have portions of their bowel removed, sometimes have Crohn's pop up in a new part.	NEGATIVE
I would recommend getting a capsule endoscopy.	NEUTRAL
You swollow a camera in a pill that sends photos every three seconds to a machine that you wear around your stomach for the day.	NEUTRAL
It does not hurt at all and it eventually comes out naturally like anything else.	POSITIVE
trust me ,when a doctor does a colonoscopy,he goes into the small intestines, most people with crohns has it in the iliuem.i got dignosed with crohns disease in the year 2000,.	NEUTRAL

NEGATIVE
I am in a similar situation and trying to get a second opinion at this point.	NEUTRAL
I have been having intestinal problems since 2002 and just a year ago got a dr to finally find a colonoscopy necessary.	NEUTRAL
I was diagnosed from that with non specific non ulcerative colitis.	NEUTRAL
I suffer daily with mucousy diarhea, and abdominal cramping and pain.	NEGATIVE
Recently I develped a peri rectal abcess and fistula that I am seeing a colorectal surgeon for, who informed me that I had been misdiagnosed by the first GI dr because the only two conditions that can cause that kind of fistula is crohns or ulcerative colitis.	NEGATIVE
I have only been treated for the currest symptoms with hyoscamine and another med but I can't remember what it was offhand...started with an L i think but I couldn't handle the side effects from it.	NEGATIVE
I am not getting much relief from the medications that I have been given.	NEGATIVE

Through a colonoscopy there was some inflammation but they still did got get me a diagnoses (5 Colonoscopies later).	NEGATIVE
It was not until my dr ran a specific blood test for Chrons that came back abnormal was I finally diagnosed with Chrons.	NEGATIVE
Be very insistent, we know our bodies better than any dr out there.	NEUTRAL

Hope nobody ever has to wait as long as I did for help and treatment.	NEUTRAL

When you are in a ""major"" flare up verses the everyday things that come with this illness, and anything else in your life that can be compounding the ""stress situation"" ie..family, kids, work, fear of losing job/medical benefits, possible surgery, ect...	NEGATIVE
it all adds to the stress your body is under while trying to fend off the attack on our immune systems, therefore you could be susceptible to further outbreaks.	NEGATIVE

So now, I have health insurance and the means to pay for treatment needed to get tested, 'which scares the **** out of me', to see if I have it, so I can get the right treatment.	NEGATIVE
But my symptoms have progressed since my last visit...	NEGATIVE
now I have 'hemmroid-like' protrusions around my anus that bleed, and burn lightly...on a good day, and I have dealt with this for a year, outta fear of doctors.	NEGATIVE
I have lived my life as a straight man and was even married to a wonderful woman......be safe, no matter how much you trust someone...	NEUTRAL
I feel like damaged goods now.	NEGATIVE
Take care.	NEUTRAL
Hey guys, if you have any questions that still need answers please post a new question so we can help you out.	POSITIVE
Thank you!	NOT_LABELED
Hi Guys, I see this is a really old thread, but I want to share the info I have on this matter as it 's a top very close to my heart and I want to help anyone I can who is also struggling with these health issues...	POSITIVE
I have struggled with IBS-C since I was a little girl, and contracted HSV2 about 5 years ago.	NEUTRAL
I have dealt with weekly, if not daily, herpes outbreaks since my contracting it.	NEGATIVE
I found when my gut acted up (pain, distention, bloating, constipation etc), I would get an outbreak within hours.	NEGATIVE
Even taking Valtex at 1G per day didn't stop it.	NEGATIVE
I work out regularly, eat a whole foods diet and have seen a therapist regularly to manage stress.	NEUTRAL
Nothing helped, if anything it got worse over the years.	NEGATIVE
I have only recently, in the past year, found out that the underlying cause of IBS is often a condition called SIBO (small intestinal bacteria overgrowth).	NEUTRAL
This is when bacteria that is only meant to be in the large intestine makes its way up in to the small intestine.	NEUTRAL
This can cause damage to the mucosal lining of the small intestine as well as create gas, blasting, constipation, diarrhea, food intolerances, chronic fatigue etc.	NEUTRAL
The reason this happens is due to low stomach acid, pancreatic exocrine function, and/or malfunctioning ileocecal valve.Bascially stress from emotions, food, drugs (recreational or pharma) all contribute to this problem.	NEUTRAL
The overgrowth of bacteria in the small intestine leads to a lot of endotoxins (waste) from the bacteria.	NEUTRAL
This waste damages the nerves surrounding in the gut leading to issues with motility (constipation, diarrhea), and weakens the immune system.	NEUTRAL
This is what lead to an opportunity for the herpes virus to express itself in me regularly.	NEGATIVE
It took me years to find this out.	NEGATIVE
I thought I was being punished and was always going to have this health situation, but luckily, I don't.	POSITIVE
To heal SIBO, you need to have a doctor or nutritionist supervise and provide a healing protocol via a diet called 'Low FODMAP"", and one, to several rounds of either pharmaceutical or herbal antibiotics to rebalance the microbiome.	NEUTRAL
The low FODMAP's diet will reduce inflammation and help to starve the bacteria.	POSITIVE
Most find a huge relief in symptoms from cutting out high FODMAP foods alone, but that's only half the battle.	POSITIVE
You need the anti-microbials and re-inocculation.	NEUTRAL
Testing for SIBO is key.	NEUTRAL
You can do so through a Naturopath or Nutritionist.	NEUTRAL
It's important to know you have it for sure.	NEUTRAL
Keep in mind, studies are now proving that SIBO is the underlying case of IBS, and can be cured with patience and diligence.	NEUTRAL
So, the link between IBS and herpes is real.	NEUTRAL
IBS/SIBO severely weakens the immune system and creates the space of the virus to wreak havoc.	NEUTRAL
When you get the gut micrbiome under control, the virus will not have the same opportunities to express itself.	POSITIVE
I really hope this helps many of you struggling with this.	POSITIVE
I know it can seem like a hopeless issue and if I can add any other energy to this I'd say; please take self-judgement out of the mix.	NEUTRAL
I know, easier said than done but at the end of the day it's just a virus.	POSITIVE
It doesn't define us.	NOT_LABELED
Self-judgment will only lead to more stress and we don't need more of that.	NEGATIVE
And there is someone out there that will fully accept you the way you are.	POSITIVE
I promise you that.	NEUTRAL
Stay positive, full of optimism and self-love and don't settle.	POSITIVE
You can heal these issues.	POSITIVE
xo.	NOT_LABELED

but my doctor said that its only 80% right he says hes possitive its crones.	NEUTRAL

GO TO A CHIROPRACTOR!	NEUTRAL
DO NOT START WITH PAIN MEDS!!	NEGATIVE
I have had Ulcerative Colitis since I was 18, 12 years now, and have been through every med available.	NEUTRAL
Two weeks ago I had the most severe back pain ever and did not want to go to my regular doctor for pain medication.	NEGATIVE
There had to be something better than being on pain medication.	NEGATIVE
I was told by several friends to see a chiroprator.	NEUTRAL
THIS WAS THE BEST DECISION OF MY LIFE!	POSITIVE
I have been seeing a chiropractor for the last 3 weeks for my lower back pain, but I have noticed tremendous relief with my ulcerative colitis which was unexpected.	POSITIVE
I had always had discomfort in my lower back especially on my right side, like a pinched nerve feeling which made it very difficult to sleep on that side or even sit.	NEGATIVE
The pain I felt prior to going to the chiropractor was that same pinched nerve feeling put right in the middle of my lower back which effected both sides of my body.	NEGATIVE
After the x-rays my chiropractor took, I was shocked!	POSITIVE
There was a twist in my lower back that veered to the right (where all the pain of my colitis is located!	NEUTRAL
) I have been pain free since my adjustments and am on a 10 week fix plan.	POSITIVE
Everything in our body is linked to our spine, that is where all our nerves control other parts of our body.	NEUTRAL
I never would have put two and two together, but it has brought tremendous relief to me that I could never have imagined!	POSITIVE
Remember: You have nothing to lose by going to the chiropractor first.	POSITIVE
Surgeries and Pain meds will stay with you for a lifetime!	NEUTRAL
Those should be your VERY LAST options!	NEGATIVE
I have had the disease for two years now and I have only had about 10 days where I haven't had pain in my back legs knees shoulders and my abdomen without taking any meds.	NEGATIVE
I was taking 16 pills a day to clam down the back pain along with my burning sensation in my abdomen.	NEGATIVE
Finally I took Tramodol and that saved my life.	POSITIVE
If I don't take it when I get up the pain in my back, abdomen, pelvis and knees kills me.	NEGATIVE
I work in surgery and I have to walk and stand on really hard floors so that doesn't help at all.	NEGATIVE
I hate waking up in the morning with a burning sensation in my abdomen and the pain and weakness I occur when I sleep for more than 5 hours at a time.	NEGATIVE
I went to a chiropractor and he really really screwed up my back.	NEGATIVE
He hurt me more than I could imagine.	NEGATIVE
So I started to go and get a message once a week and that helps a lot with my lower back pain.	POSITIVE
I have been on pentasa for the last 2 years and I think my body has become acustomed to the dosage and I have had 5 flair ups since January.	POSITIVE
I just got off a 3 month course of steroids and I felt wonderful for about 1 month now I'm back to the back pain, joint pain, the bloating abdomen pain and flair ups!	NEGATIVE
I hate it.	NEGATIVE
My Crohns doctor is best friends with my husband and he still can't help me.	NEGATIVE
I think its a wicked disease that no one really understands and if you don't have it you don't really understand the pain that is involved with crohns.	NEGATIVE
I have to live on Tramodol or else I'm in constant pain.	NEGATIVE
I have to go off the tramodol for periods of times so I don't get addicted to it.	NEGATIVE
And its those times I hate even moving!	NEGATIVE
I hope my story can help those who have had these problems with Crohns.	POSITIVE
I don't think anyone will find a cure as of yet but time will come and maybe there will be light at the end of the tunnel.	POSITIVE
For now I take pain meds to help with the pain if I don't take them my life is pretty hard.	NEGATIVE

Be aware that there are some types of arthritis that can go along with inflammatory bowel disease.	NEUTRAL

Quick suggestion - Yes I suffer from Crohn's however i've just had the best blood results I've ever had.	POSITIVE
No I'm not in remission and yes I still suffer (particularly as I have already lost 5% of my spine mobility due to a previous accident).	NEGATIVE
However the only thing I've done different since my last blood test is I've been eating a couple of handfuls of pepitas (pumpkin seeds - unsalted / unflavoured - just ""roasted"") a day - they have helped to reduce the inflammation - worth a try.....mind you - my back is killing me again at present and I'll do stretches etc to get it moving - i refuse to let this disease win.	POSITIVE

I had Proctitis for like 12 years and FIXED it with supplements that are Great for the brain which is a Big Bundle of Neurons because I reached the conclusion that I developed Proctitis from some really bad diahrea that I exposed myself to from Chinese food that I consumed for like 15 years.	POSITIVE
The explosive diahrea over the years caused my body to get DEFICIENT in some of those Micronutrients that are CRITICAL for neuronal health like Niacin, Magnesium, vitamin K2, etc.......	NEUTRAL
The malfunctioning or INJURED nerves cause the immune system to attack JUST like it attacks other areas that are injured like a wrist when you sprain it, an infected cut, an insect bite, etc..	NEUTRAL
To FIX those nerves you will need an account at swansonvitamins or any other supplement company to BUY:  Tripple Magnesium Complex 400mg/capsule, Balance B-100, Odor controlled garlic 500mg/capsule, Niacinamide 500 mg/capsule, Time-release vitamin c 1000 mg/capsule, vitamin k2, cayenne pepper capsule and any other supplement you feel like you will need like fish oil.........

These are Great supplements for the brain and nerves, heart, bones, etc..  for example, google: ""vitamin k2 parkinson's"" or this one: ""vitamin k2 pancreatic cancer"" Start taking vitamin K2 to make sure YOU DON'T GET CANCER!	NEUTRAL
Protocol for you to fix those nerves: -take 400 mg magnesium daily.	NEUTRAL
take a B-100 capsule with each meal.	NEUTRAL
take 2 of those 500 mg odor controlled garlic capsules with each meal if you can which comes out to some 6 capsules daily.	NEUTRAL
Garlic is very important for fixing this so TAKE as much as you and others around you can tolerate.	NEUTRAL
Garlic is SULFUR and SULFUR IS NEEDED!	NEUTRAL
take at least 4 of those time-release vitamin c 1000 mg capsules daily so that your body can make the collagen that is needed in your skin.	NEUTRAL
You may want to add L-Lysine to your vitamin-c so that your body can make Elastin which is also needed.	NEUTRAL
take 3 vitamin K2 tablets every day and make sure to take a fish pill capsule every time you take a vitamin K2 capsule.	NEUTRAL
You may consider vitamin k1 for this.	NEUTRAL
Vitamin K2 is critical for the myelin covering nerves to be made in your body.	NEUTRAL
take 2 of those 500 mg Niacinamide capsules daily, one in the morning and other in evening after supper.	NEUTRAL
experiment with just ONE cayenne capsule if you buy them but be sure to take it after one of your meals.	NEUTRAL
Your body and nerves there in your colon took years to MALFUNCTION so DO NOT EXPECT RESULTS over night, but I do promise that the Garlic, sulfur, and other micronutrients will fix it IN less than 2 years, and you'll see results within weeks if you take as much of the micro nutrients as posted........	POSITIVE
It took my Proctitis about 2.5 years for me to declare myself healed with absolutely NO SYMPTOM.	POSITIVE
One more note, do you find yourself having cramps in your calf muscle like I did for years?????  I bet you do!	NEUTRAL
This is a symptom of Magnesium deficiency!	NEUTRAL
Also every time you go to your doctor your Heart rate is constantly above 90-near tachycardia.........This is also an indication of Magnesium deficiency.	NEUTRAL
go to wikipedia and search: 'hypomagnesemia' then look at the symptoms, and I guarantee YOU WILL SEE THAT YOU ARE DEFICIENT IN JUST THIS ONE NUTRIENT!	NEUTRAL
Niacin deficiency is characterized by 4 D's.... -Diahrea, dermatitis, dementia, death.	NEUTRAL
B6 and B12 and folate deficiency equals SHRUNKEN BRAIN which means you have lost Millions of Neurons.........	NEUTRAL
You are Deficient in B-vitamins, Magnesium, vitamin K2, VITAMIN C because of the daily diahrea!	NEGATIVE
TO fix the Neurons in the colon, you must take alot of these nutrients to counteract the effect of the diahrea so DO NOT DRINK caffeine or Alcohol during this period because these are diuretics and make you urinate alot so you urinate the micronutrients out, and YOU ALREADY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE DIAHREA DEPLETING your body of them.	NEUTRAL
THE key to fixing these nerves is taking a bunch of those micronrutrients in my previous post JUST DO NOT take more than 400 mg of magnesium, any more than that and it will become a Laxative.	NEUTRAL
To get more magnesium in your depleted body, Use Epsom Salt in your bathtub when you take a bath!!!!!	NEUTRAL
They told me stress at 1st also!	NEUTRAL
Turned out its Crohns Disease but I'm still screwed bc I was exposed 2TB when I was a Pharmaceutical Tech and the meds tht help Crohns I CANT TAKE BC OF THIS EXSPOSER 10+ YRS AGO IT REALLY ***** knowing whats wrong but still no help from my Gastro Dr!	NEGATIVE
Look into LDN for Crohn's.......Buy a odor controlled garlic 500 mg/capsule from swanson because these will help you.	POSITIVE
taking those garlic tablets is like taking pure SULFUR!!!!! To convince yourself garlic plus all those supplements is what you need go to wikipedia and search ""Humira"" and look at the humira molecule to see all that sulfur...... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humira.	NEUTRAL
allicin is one of molecules in garlic so look at the sulfur in molecule.... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allicin.	NEUTRAL
Try the garlic supplements to see how much they help with the inflammation, but you better add all the other supplements like I posted before you come down with problems like osteoporosis.	NEUTRAL
Your problems could be from a variety of things.	NEUTRAL
I had Achilles tendon surgery about two months ago and develop a weird symptom of having extreme foot pain when I need to have a bowel movement or during the bowel movement.	NEGATIVE
It is a nerve issue.	NEUTRAL
However, I do need to add that I also suffer from Ulcerative colitis (similar to Crohn's disease).	NEUTRAL
The pain the legs and feet are from nerves but you need to be checked by a Gastrointestinal doc for Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, celiac disease..	NEUTRAL
among others.	NOT_LABELED
Did your pain in your foot with bowel movement go away?	NEUTRAL
I had tarsal tunnel and plantar fasciitis surgery 4 weeks ago and 2 weeks ago, I began to have burning on the ball of the foot with bowel movement.	NEGATIVE

Azathioprine made me vomit and have diarrhea at the same time -	NEGATIVE
I only took it for 2 days and was so ill a doctor had to come to my home - he gave me an anti-nausea shot and advised me to stop the drug immediately.	NEGATIVE

Thanks for your advice, its much appreciated!	POSITIVE
Hi there - not sure if I had Asacol, had so many different drugs over the past 38 yrs, as well as 30+ yrs of steroids - a no no now, but that was the only drug available to bring a flare into remission in those days.	POSITIVE
IBD drugs have come on in leaps and bounds in recent years, and although I am very stable on methotrexate there are some much newer drugs, anti-TNF biologic therapies, like Humira, Cimzia, Tysabril and Infliximab which gives one hope for the future.I don't know where you live, but believe these drugs are now available in the US but are still being trialled in the UK.	NEUTRAL
My gastro said he has never known anyone tolerate methotrexate for 7 years without serious liver side effects, but guess I have always confounded general medical issues - didn't ""present"" normally with Crohn's - no pain, just severe diarrhea and weight loss, and when I got breast cancer 5 yrs ago, I had no palpable lump.	NEGATIVE
It was found on a regular 3 yrly mammo, which is all we get here in England with our socialised health service.	NEUTRAL
If I had known what I know now, I would have had private mammos in the intervening years, and perhaps the cancer would not have spread to my lymph nodes.	NEGATIVE
Being a glass half full person, I try and find something positive in each and every day now, rather than dwelling on the past, or what may happen in the future.	POSITIVE
I do my research, am able to talk articulately to my doctors, and just so pleased to be alive, even with a somewhat curtailed lifestyle.	POSITIVE
Hope you get some relief soon for your symptoms - if I can help in any further way, just let me know.	POSITIVE
Take care, Liz.	NOT_LABELED
Hi again, just had a thought that may help you.	POSITIVE
When I was on FEC chemo for breast cancer, I was very sick (vomiting and diarrhea) and couldn't even eat a mouthful of home made vegetable soup with the solids strained out without rushing to the loo.	NEGATIVE
My Oncologist prescribed a small daily dose of dexamethasone (a steroid) and got the hospital to send me a huge carton of Fortijuice - a vitamin and mineral juice type drink - 9 different flavours, all yucky, but I had to have some nourishment to stay alive.	NEUTRAL
Each carton had 300 cals and I had to sip 3 cartons a day.	NEUTRAL
Did the trick!	NOT_LABELED
I also had bad nausea, and found that any drink with ginger in it did quell it somewhat.	POSITIVE
I seemed to have drunk gallons of non alcoholic ginger beer (cloudy and fizzy) and ginger ale (clear and fizzy), plus the occasional treat of Stone's Green Ginger wine - slightly alcoholic, topped up with ice and ginger ale.	NEUTRAL
These drinks stopped me from becoming dehydrated.	POSITIVE
I did lose some 28 lbs during the 4 months of FEC chemo, but have put it back on thankfully and am steady at 112 lbs.	POSITIVE

I feel good on this forum being able to talk about my disease without feeling like I'm complaining.	POSITIVE

Hi - good to hear you are feeling a tad better and eating a little.	POSITIVE
Not sure which meds you want advice on - I take, on rising, one codeine phosphate (helps with the lower abdomen pain), one imodium, to slow down the motility, one folic acid (necessary when taking methotrexate) and inject myself with 12.5mg of methotrexate weekly.	NEUTRAL
(I take other meds for breast cancer and osteopenia).	NEUTRAL
Mtx can be very toxic to the liver especially, but I have monthly blood tests and am tolerating it well.	POSITIVE

Stopped 4 weeks ago and the pain has diminished somewhat.	POSITIVE
Seeing GP 28th May for referral to a new Oncologist as mine retired last year.	NEUTRAL
You are right to steer clear of steroids.	POSITIVE
When I was dx in 1970, the dark ages as far as Crohn's was concerned, the only med to bring a flare into remission was prednisone, and the thinking then was it would keep one in remission, which has now been proven to be inaccurate.	NEGATIVE
I was on steroids, varying amounts, for 30 yrs and this has played havoc with my bone density, which is classed osteopenic after various DEXA scans.	NEGATIVE
I take alendronic acid (a bisphosphonate) weekly, and daily Calcichew/Vit.D to strengthen my bones and prevent further loss.	NEUTRAL
Nobody told me all those years ago that steroids did this, perhaps they didn't know, but even if they had, there was no alternative to steroids.	NEGATIVE
Happily, there are so many new drugs now for Crohn's, it seems to be a question of trial and error to find one that keeps you in remission.	POSITIVE
Guess I discovered the holy grail when I found mtx on the internet and badgered my then gastro to prescribe it off licence.	POSITIVE
It is still not licensed in England for Crohn's as the mfrs feel there are too few patients to make the licensing costs worthwhile.	NEGATIVE
Are you on an immuno-suppressant?	NEUTRAL
I remember some years ago when the Crohn's & Colitis Foundation of America (CCFA) had a website where questions were answered foc by a retired gastroenterologist, Dr. Eugene May.	NEUTRAL
That forum is now defunct, due to legal problems, diagnosing/prescribing over the net.	NEUTRAL
However, Dr. May did say that Crohn's patients should always be on an immuno-suppressant (like mtx), because the disease is incurable.	NEGATIVE
I have not had a flare since taking mtx, except for a bad one when having FEC chemo for breast cancer and had to stop the mtx.	POSITIVE

I am a former patient of Dr may and I have a question I need to ask him is he still available?	NEUTRAL
I've had Crohn's for 18 years, and I've had my share of meds.	NEUTRAL
Prednizone, Sulfasalazine (Azulfidine), and more recently ENTOCORT EC (a nonsystemic corticosteroid)- basically works like a steroid without going into the bloodstream, so it has very limited side effects.	NEUTRAL
My Crohn's has always been upper track, especially in the stomach.	NEUTRAL
If my stomach is upset with stress, booze, or too much acid I get horrible stomach pains and usually vomit and dont eat for several days.	NEGATIVE
My health insurace decided to stop covering my medicine for heart burn, Protonix, they want me to use over the counter digestive band aides.	NEGATIVE
This stresses me out, so I get sick.	NEGATIVE
I also manage my Crohn's with Canabis.	NEUTRAL
When I first started smoking, my major symptom-appetite loss all but disappeared.	POSITIVE
Then I was able to start looking at other supplements and how to treat Crohn's with better eating.	POSITIVE
No more red meat, especially red meat that is fed with corn- this means no fast food, no mystery meat!	NEUTRAL
I had an almost immediate health turn around after making this change.	POSITIVE
No more corn!	NEUTRAL
Especially processed corn, it destroys your insides by throwing off the natural fatty acid balance.	NEGATIVE

When your DR prescribes antibiotics, make sure to take Probiotics to increase healthy micro-flora.	NEUTRAL
Find out where you need nutrients and supplement wisely.	NEUTRAL

I am a 25 year old female.	NEUTRAL
I was diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis almost a year ago after having a bad attack after pizza one weekend that never went away.	NEGATIVE
It took about 3 months of extreme pain, biopsys, barium tests, and a colonoscopy to find out what I was sick with.	NEGATIVE
I spent 3 months off of work resting at home because I became so sick and malnourishment and too many trips to the bathroom to count.	NEGATIVE
The pain I experienced was horrible.	NEGATIVE
I would get bundled over with abdomal pain and just start crying in front of my customers due to the insane pain.	NEGATIVE
I was put on my first treatment of ENTOCORT EC for 4 months along with Protonix for the heartburn, and another pill for the nausea.	NEUTRAL
I was able to return to work after 3 months but was still feeling very ill.	NEUTRAL
Its been almost a year and I am not healing as suspected so I am on my second round of treatment with Entocort and protonix.	NEUTRAL
I am struggling to find out what my body can eat and what it cant.	NEUTRAL
I am still throwing up a few days in a row in the mornings no matter what it is that I eat and It seems that when I start to feel ill it last about a week.	NEGATIVE
Everyday is a different story and that is frustrating in itself.	NEGATIVE
This has taken a toll on my normal cheery self and the steroids give me horrible side effects including: depression, insomnia, weight gain, sweats, nausea, etc.	NEGATIVE
The depression is the worst, I feel very angry that at 24 years old I have been handed this card and I am not able to live the life of a normal 25 year old right now.	NEGATIVE
Its going to take some time to get use to the idea but I believe everything happens for a reason and we arent given more than we can handle...most of the time.	NEUTRAL
I wish the best of luck to everyone and Its not an easy journey but you are a stronger person for doing it.	POSITIVE

Hi, my boyfriend got diagnosed with Crohn's disease last year and has been hospitalized around 6 times.	NEUTRAL
He has been on a few different medications and all seem to do NOTHING.	NEGATIVE
He has now been throwing for the last 2 days, trying to only eat what the Dr. told him (soup broth, ginger ale & crackers).	NEGATIVE
The interesting thing is he isn't throwing up any food, its all acid & the last 2 days its been just about every 2 hours.	NEGATIVE
He's taking 6mp right now & refuses to take the nausea meds cause it gives him a horrible migraine.	NEGATIVE
Is there something the Dr. is missing, not giving him, or any other medications out there that work better in these cases?	NEUTRAL
If so I would greatly appreciate some advice.	POSITIVE
Thank You!	NOT_LABELED
Hi All, I thought I would let some people know what my experiences were.	NEUTRAL
I have Ulcerative colitis, and really from the start (3 - 4 years) i have had constant morning nausea.	NEUTRAL
To be 100% honest, I get nausea and dry reaching / vommiting, but it is almost always when I get up, and before I eat, normally in the shower i have 5 - 10 mins of dry reaching.	NEGATIVE
It is not effected by bowel movements, i.e I have not gone to the toilet or even after I still get it.	NEUTRAL
I changed my meds from salfa to mesaline and that made a 10% difference, certainly not signifant but enough to offer a little relief.	POSITIVE
I have not found a solution to preventing something like this, and again being honest its something that I have almost gotten used to, its not something that I like to have to go through every morning, nor is it nice for my partner to listen to, but I certainly am getting used to it, and not eating before makes it a little easier, if i was to have breakfast then be sick, i would not be able to handle it, so I normally don't eat breakfast.	NEUTRAL
Sorry its not a solution, rather another perspective.	NEUTRAL
Just wondering if ant fellow crohnies out there have had kidney trouble.	NEUTRAL

My surgeon was able to perform a Restorative Proctocolectomy, so I have an internal J-Pouch.	NEUTRAL
Life with the J-Pouch has been tons better than with the rogue colon, but it has never been 100%.	POSITIVE
My doctor and I have tried all kinds of medications to get it to calm down, Flagyl, Amitriptylin, Glycopyrrolate, Xiflaxin.	NEUTRAL
The only thing that has seemed to help was Ciprofloxacn, which then stopped working after a time and now works again in combination with Tindamax.	POSITIVE
My surgeon would prefer me not to be continuously on two antibiotics and I would certainly prefer that too, but the alternative is not fun, cramping, constant bathroom visits and the worst is leakage at night.	NEGATIVE
Does ANYONE have any remedies, natural therapies, a different medication to suggest, really anything?	NEUTRAL
I have also tried a course of probiotics while not taking medication and my pouch just continued to get worse.	NEGATIVE
Have they looked at your diet?	NEUTRAL
You may be eating too much fiber, sugar and/or spices.	NEGATIVE
I've had my pouch for 15 years and definitely the first year or so was tough but I eventually got into the habit of eating bulking foods (oatmeal, marshmallows, apple sauce, meats, eggs) and avoided heavy fiber foods and spices.	NEUTRAL
Eventually I've been able to eat anything but occasionally if I have too much spicy or too much salads or sugar I run into problems.	NEGATIVE
I assume you take an anti-diarrheal?	NEUTRAL
Thank you for your response.	POSITIVE
Unfortunately, even when I had Ulcerative Colitis, diet never seemed to make a difference.	NEGATIVE
However, I do avoid spicy foods because they do bring pain.	NEGATIVE
As far as anti-diarrheals, I have tried Imodium, but it seemed to make me feel like I had a blockage or constipation, but maybe I was taking too many or something.	NEGATIVE
Thank you for the thoughts; I'd definitely appreciate any more you might have.	POSITIVE
There are some other prescription drugs your doctor can give you - antispasmodics.	NEUTRAL

My doctor is now going to try the drug 6mp because I have fistula's and ulcers.	NEGATIVE
He said if that doesnt work the drug called Remicade would be his 2nd option.	NEUTRAL
Maybe you should ask your doctor about those two drugs as well.	NEUTRAL
Cka58 I feel your pain its like a never ending battle with UC.	NEUTRAL
Trudie thats strange you mentioned you felt like you had a blockage after taking Imodium.	NEUTRAL
because after my surgery maybe 6 months after they started me on that and I ended up getting a blockage which they had to go in and correct.	NEGATIVE
I always thought it was from that drug as well.	NEGATIVE
If you want to slow down ur bathroom visits i'd say take metamucil.	NEUTRAL

Talk to your doc about xifaxan.	NEUTRAL
It's an antibiotic that only impacts the digestive tract.	NEUTRAL
I've had chronic pouchitis since getting my pouch 11 yrs ago, and this is the only thing that helps.	NEUTRAL
I also take a small amount of probiotic in the form of yogurt every day.	NEUTRAL
That's counterintuitive with the antibiotic, but they seem to strike a better balance that with the antibiotic alone.	POSITIVE
I have had j-pouch since 1991 and last few years have had very bad pouchitis overflow incontinence.	NEGATIVE
Pouch nurse gave me a Medina cathater which is a tube with which you can empty the pouch.	NEUTRAL

It is amazing and never hurts my stomach!	POSITIVE
I strongly suggest you make some.	POSITIVE

I have severe pain and spasms in my anal and pouch area that if not treated I'm sure I would die from heart failure because this pain is absolutely intolerable.	NEGATIVE
I have been on high doses of morphine since the day of my surgery.	NEUTRAL
I take 15mg of morphine every 8 hours plus breakthrough throughout the day as needed.	NEUTRAL
I have pouchitis all the time and now my pouch is ulcerated.	NEGATIVE
I have incontinence through out the night.	NEGATIVE
Go to the bathroom at least 7-8 times a day.	NEGATIVE
I use to be a runner but now can have no physical activity because of my incontinence and frequent bathroom stops.	NEGATIVE
If I do anything physical or lift anything heavy I through myself into spasm which then require more morphine to manage my pain.	NEGATIVE
I'm tired, depressed and scared to think this is my life.	NEGATIVE
I have been seeing Dr. Bo Shen of the Cleveland Clinic who gives me alcohol and kenelog injections into the cuff of my J-pouch evert 6-months and at first this seemed to help with some of my pain and I was able to decrease my morphine intake.	POSITIVE
However, lately I feel little relief.	NEGATIVE
I haven't heard anyone talk about pain.	NEUTRAL
Really need some advice and encouragement.	NEUTRAL

When my Gastro told me that I needed to have my colon out I was devastated.	NEGATIVE
I had researched the ""bag"" and was not pleased with the results.	NEGATIVE
I also was not excited about the J-pouch option as it did not seem to improve the quality of life much and so I looked further into the BCIR option.	NEUTRAL
I had a total proctocolectomy on 3/21/14 and life is getting better.	POSITIVE
The BCIR is similar to a Koch pouch with an improved valve design so there is no incontinence/leakage.	POSITIVE
I wish more Doctors knew about this option to at least give us, their patients more choices.	NEUTRAL
Dr. Ernest Rehnke from the Palms of Pasadena Hospital in St. Petersburg, Florida is an extremely talented surgeon and the staff at the Palms is fantastic.	POSITIVE

I already have to get up an hour early to take all my morning meds.LOL.	NEGATIVE
What a yummy breakfast!	NEGATIVE
I have seen that a few people take Aleve to help with this.	NEUTRAL
My GI claim that is the worse thing to take with Crohn's.	NEGATIVE
I was taking it and getting some relief, until he said that.	POSITIVE
hey i understand your pain, i have crohn's as well and i've been dealing with arthritis on hands and feet and my ring finger on both hands go numb every day along with pain that radiates to my elbow.	NEGATIVE

Advil causes bleeding, etc. ladybea.	NEGATIVE
I was diagnosed with Chrons in 11/07.	NEUTRAL
The only reason I am at this point is that in June 07 I began having wicked arthritis in my entire body.	NEGATIVE
I could barely move, pick things up, etc.	NEGATIVE
After many doctor visits, appointments with numerous specialists (including an RA specialist, after taking many ugly meds with bad side effects) I was sent to a GI and diagnosed with Chrons Colitis.	NEUTRAL
He said that the arthritis is a direct side effect of the Chrons.	NEUTRAL
I only got my life back after a crazy regimine of steroids and Celebrex.	NEGATIVE
Now I am being weened off of the steroids (it is painful and the arthritis flares up every now and then) and am on Imuran and am bouncing back.	POSITIVE
Unfortutanely I still have to deal with the issues with the damage I sustained when my immune system decided to attack all my joints.	NEGATIVE
I feel for you all, and it seems mostly ladies?	NEUTRAL
I have had Crohns for over 25 years and have had three resections in 1984, 2001 & 2007	NEUTRAL

For around a year now I have been on infleximab by infusion, Methotrexate tablets as well as taking Questran to help digestion, folic acid and 3 monthly B12 injections.	NEUTRAL
I have had some trouble over the years with stiff joints in my hands, mostly in winter, but around four months ago I started getting real pain in my hands and fingers followed by them swelling, this then started in my feet and ankles, legs, knees, arms elbows and shoulders and seems to move from one place to the other on a 2-3 day basis, it sometimes even changes from being severe to the point of not being able to use my hands to just a slight pain and completely moved to, say a knee or a foot over night.	NEGATIVE
My only respite now is too many pain killers and complete rest, as soon as I work (I don't to anything too manual these days) or take exersize one or another, or several of my limbs will be extremely painfull or sore to touch very soon after.	NEGATIVE
The pain is not confined to my joints, in fact there is not always pain in the joint, more around it and in cases up my arm or leg, more like, and it changes, tendon or muscle pain.	NEGATIVE
Yesterday my ankle was swollen and painfull to move, enough to cause me to limp and my calf muscle felt as though I had a severe cramp in it every time I put my foot to the floor.	NEGATIVE
The strangest thing is this continuing changing of the area that gives most pain.	NEUTRAL
I am coming to the end of my tether with this, my Doctors keep telling me its to do with the Crohns, we will have to do more tests etc.etc.	NEGATIVE
My Crohns has been very good as far as I am concerned for some time now, although I have recently had a pillcam which seems to reveal that the Crohns is active but there is nowhere to go medically, looking like the only option is more surgery.	NEUTRAL
If the surgery would get rid of the new symptoms while the Crohns stays at bay, great but I am now 54 and not keen on yet more surgery when I feel in myself that this is a seperate issue from the Crohns.	NEGATIVE
There are apparently more than 70 kinds of arthuritis, is it possible that this has nothing to do with the Crohns and should be investigated on its own symptoms?	NEUTRAL
I find if you have Crohns any other ailment at all is lumped in with it, ""Oh that's to do with your Crohns"" is sometimes a very convenient answer.	NEUTRAL
Any help at all would be appreciated, if any one else experienced anything like this or any proffesionals out there have heard of similar symptoms please get in touch through this site or direct to ***@**** Thanks.	NEUTRAL

It's very difficult trying to work or even explain to some people what is going on with my body.	NEGATIVE
Some days I wake up and everything is just fine and some days I'm drained because I may have spent half the night in the bathroom or I wake up to some part of my body being swollen.	NEGATIVE
Sometimes it's the joints but more often than not it's the area around the joints (from the RP).	NEUTRAL
In the last year I've had swelling/inflammations in my nose, ear, face, neck, elbow, wrists, arm, fingers and toes.	NEGATIVE
One day both of my ankles were totally swollen and I was confined to bed which is very difficult with UC.	NEGATIVE
It's become a running joke each day to see what part of my body is sore or inflamed as I'm trying to see the humor in all of this to keep from crying.	NEGATIVE
Anyway, just wanted to say it's actually good to know that I'm really not alone in this craziness.	POSITIVE

I have also dealt with back pain for the last 20 years and have always dealt with it via chiro, acupuncture, massage, physio, swimming etc.	NEUTRAL
but in the last 6 months I've had some episodes that have been the most painful of my life and have only recently been told that the two are likely related.	NEGATIVE
I've been on Humira for 2 yrs, infliximab I reacted badly too, and colazide gives me diarhea, and the sulfasalizine type drugs just do bugger all.	NEGATIVE
I want to only to say I empathise with you all.	POSITIVE
To others we look like we're okay, it's hard for them to understand the excrutiating pain we can be in.	NEGATIVE

I make sure I eat lots of healthy, grass fed red meat and well cooked vegetables.	NEUTRAL

I thought I was CRAZY.	NEGATIVE
I have a appt with Gastro shortly.	NEUTRAL
Hopefully they can help with all this crazy pain.	POSITIVE
Wow.	NOT_LABELED
I read this discussion and it could have been parts of my own life!!!	NEUTRAL
I was diagnosed with crohns 17 years ago when I was 19.	NEUTRAL
Spent the first 12 years having the digestive issues most of you guys described, including about a foot of bowel removed (iliem area) when I was 28.	NEUTRAL
For the last 6 years it's been less digestive issues, though they are still there, and more joint issues.	NEGATIVE
I have 3 vertebrae in my lower back that a back doc told me look like a 90 year old ditch digger's because of the amount of inflammation/arthritis affecting them.	NEGATIVE
My knees, wrists, feet, toes, hips ...All can and will ache depending on the day/ moment.	NEGATIVE
I have plantar facitis (sp)- inflamed tendons on the bottom of my feet, supposed gout in my left big toe - but it's ALL inflammation of 1 type or another.	NEUTRAL
I'm taking hydromorphcontin every day wondering if I'm getting physically dependent on it, but not able to walk properly or ""manage my life"" if I don't take it.	NEGATIVE
ie. Too stiff & sore & in too much pain to do simple things like cook, clean, go to the playground with my son (6 yrs old).	NEGATIVE
I also have a spouse who tells me my pain is mostly ""in my head"" & I don't need the pain meds.	NEGATIVE
I don't get a ""high"" from them, take them exactly as prescribed and have stopped taking them only to be unable to sleep & go from bed, straight to sofa in the morning because I'm to stiff & sore & in pain to do anything.	NEGATIVE
I've met people with ""regular"" arthritis (reumatiod & osteo) and generally the people I've met say they suffer more from stiffnes & with RA deformaties but don't appear to have the ""traveling"" inflammation of the joints I do (as in one day my knees are worse, few days later it seems my wrists are worse, my back always hurts).	NEUTRAL
Has any one else run into this?	NEUTRAL
I believe I have a very high pain tolerance lol after crohns for this long I've only been on regular pain meds for the last 4 years.	POSITIVE
With the gut pain we can get people with crohns develop a high pain tolerance I believe.	POSITIVE
I've tried humira but reacted to it.	NEGATIVE
I also tried remicade a few years ago but had to stop because I got really run down & sick & couldn't get healthly again.	NEGATIVE
My gastrio-doc is thinking of remicade again or referring me to a reumatiod arthritis doc, waiting for blood work to come back.	NEUTRAL
In addition to humira (allerigic), remicade, I've been on pentasa, salofalk (sp?), entocort & prednisone, (so sick of cortisteroids), & immurane ( got very very sick from).	NEGATIVE
Anyway not that I wish these problems on anyone but it is nice to hear about them & know a person isn't the only one going through it, especially when (for me at least) the people closest to me really have no idea what it's like.	POSITIVE
Thanks for letting me ramble.	POSITIVE
Hi, I was diagnosed with crohns disease in 2003, I had one colon resection in 2006.	NEUTRAL
I am in pain everyday, and I too think that I am crazy, and would not ever wish this debilitating disease on no one.	NEGATIVE
I am always reading to find out more about this disease.	NEUTRAL
I change my diet from time to time, but it is never the same.	NEUTRAL

I get sick just thinking about what to eat and what not to eat.	NEGATIVE
I have taken Asacol, Imuran, prednisone, entocort, and the list goes on.	NEUTRAL
I try to pray daily, but my mind is so much on the pain, I forget to sometimes.	NEGATIVE
I ache through out my whole body daily, I go through the pain and every other night I take a vicodin to help me sleep.	NEGATIVE
(do not want to become addicted) tylenol nor tylenol PM works for me anymore.	NEGATIVE
I have Rheumatoid arthritis stemming from the crohns.	NEUTRAL
Sometime I do not even know what to say or how to describe my pain anymore, because it just seems as though people do not believe you, and I guess because I still have to get up and do what I have to do; cook, clean, wash, drive kids, which is dangerous because my legs sometimes lock up on me and I have to pull over until the pain goes away.	NEGATIVE
I feel for everyone on this panel and I understand the misery of Crohns, we are not CRAZY, just in constant PAIN.	NEGATIVE
Hi, I am back, (Nace1) my first post was June 7th 2010, where I spoke about having had Crohn's for some 26/7 years, 3 Ops, (bowel resections) and at date of that post 4 months of severe migrating joint pain.	NEGATIVE
So here we are 14 months later with an update: Many consultations later with both Gastro & Reumatologist, Reumo is baffled by what is going on as many tests show no degradation associated with arthritis but believes in my pain and has seen physical and photographic evidence of swellings	NEUTRAL
In summary thinks its connected to the Crohn's, somehow?	NEUTRAL
Gastro is convinced the Crohn's is under control and therefore joint & other area's with these symptoms are not connected ?	NEUTRAL
so, not the Crohn's?	NEUTRAL
So neither of them are taking any responsibility, they cant both be right unless it is something completely different?	NEUTRAL
I am so so frustrated, I am sure I could handle the pain and disability better if I new what it is and what to expect, I am now unable to work full time or plan anything as I don't know from one day to the next how I am going to be.	NEGATIVE
I don't know the answers, but it does help to speak with people who have an idea what I am going through, so thanks for that at least guys, actually I think mostly ladies on this forum, I feel for you all.	POSITIVE
Paul.	NOT_LABELED
Hi, Yes, it's probably all related, because Crohn's and arthritis are both auto-immune conditions, where the body's immune system attacks the body itself.	NEUTRAL
I did it the other way round, I've had arthritis for many years, since my 30s (I'm now 61) and I got Crohn's at age 54.	NEUTRAL
It was blamed on the anti-inflammatory drugs I had been taking for years.	NEGATIVE
I have especially bad arthritis in my spine and can't now take much in the way of anti-inflammatory, only 1 tab of naproxen a day, but it does take the edge off.	NEGATIVE
What's really good for joints is green-lipped mussel supplement, freely available.	POSITIVE
I got on to it because the vet gave one of our dogs some for hip arthritis and within a couple of days she was jumping round like a puppy, so I thought if it works for the dog, it's gotta help me too!	POSITIVE
Give that a try, it doesn't seem to irritate the gut.	POSITIVE
Hey this i think is defiantly crohn's related...	NEUTRAL
I'm a 30 yr old female who was diagnosed with Crohn's earlier this year & also diagnosed with Psoriatic Arthritis a few months ago.	NEUTRAL
I'm in pain all the time & it *****, i know how it feels...	NEGATIVE
I too also have to go see a Reumatologist for the Psoriatic Arthritis & i'm taking Embrel Shots 2x a week for it cause i have plaque masses on my hands, elbows, knees, back & the whole top of my right foot & those are all the places i also have joint pain too :( They itch all the time, they are red & swollen but i not only do i feel the pain on the outside of my skin, i feel it in my joints too.	NEGATIVE
Hi I have Crohns disease and have just started getting alot of joint pain , mainly in my right hip , its so bad some times i am unable to weight bare on it , Any advice ?	NEGATIVE
Well like the most of you I've been on this roller coaster for 18 years now with Colitis, my hips and knees were getting so sore I was having trouble trying to sleep.	NEGATIVE
After feeling my GI was enjoying his work just a little too much and feeling embarrassed to go for appointments I switched to a new GI who after five years has never given me a rectal exam in his office.	NEGATIVE
He put me on 300 mg of Celebrix/ day and after one month the only time my hips bother me is if I walk further than I should and yes definitely related to Chron's and Colitis.	POSITIVE
Now there are two different dosages depending on which Arthritis your GI puts down you are being treated for, the milder sorry if that sounds insensitive only allows 200 mg for insurance purposes where the nastier form allows for 400 mg.	NEUTRAL
I'm sorry I haven't got the names I know one is Rumathoid but I think you should get the idea.	NEUTRAL
so my GI gives me 300 mg because 200 wouldn't do it.	NEUTRAL
Good Luck to you all and may God Bless.	POSITIVE
Rick.	NOT_LABELED
Trina is that what it's called  green-lipped mussel supplement, from what I know Celebrex is better than Naproxin and doesn't bother me at all at 300 mg / day, my hips and knees have finally stopped bothering me.	POSITIVE
My Colitis has been contributed to my anti inflamatory Feldene 200 mg / day I was taking following three failed back surgeries.	NEUTRAL
Strange they gave me the good old reliable strong one and really messed me up.	NEGATIVE
It's funny our pets get better meds than we do.	NEGATIVE
I just want to make sure of the name of the other, they won't give my wife the same as me so she still suffers, maybe it will work for her too Thank in advance.	NEGATIVE

Hi, I was diagnosed with UC in 2007 and have had a couple bad flares, bad enough to be hospitalized for.	NEGATIVE
I have seen major improvement in my digestion since I started the Specific Carbohydrate Diet (SCD) via Elaine Gottshalls book Breaking the Vicious Cycle.	POSITIVE
I still have some joint pains buy they seem to be improving.	POSITIVE
Epsom salts baths add some relief.	POSITIVE
Mostly my knee and elbow right now.	NEUTRAL
I am not on any meds and do not want to take any so I'm looking for relief naturally.	NEUTRAL
It seems excersize helps some too.	POSITIVE
Thanks, Don M.	NOT_LABELED
I was diagnosed with UC 15 years ago that never went into remission and I had a colectomy with j-pouch surgery 13 years ago.	NEGATIVE
That took care of the intestinal issues, but I have had fatigue and joint/muscle aches all along the way and they have recently gotten worse.	NEGATIVE
The slightest exertion can leave me achy, weak, nauseous, and blurred vision for 1-3 days after.	NEGATIVE
Usually I'm battling fatigue and aches on a regular basis, but it gets a lot worse after any exertion.	NEGATIVE
All blood work comes back normal.	POSITIVE
Doctor has me on fish oil and anti-depressants.	NEUTRAL
They help a little.	POSITIVE
So I'm another example of this IBD-related pain syndrome.	NEUTRAL
Feeling pretty hopeless but plan to try arthritis medicine like Celebrex if doc agrees.	NEGATIVE
Your symptoms are the same as mine.	NEUTRAL
My bowels are in remission, but I suffer with fistulas.	NEGATIVE
I have been having the same arthritis symptoms for the past year, severe.	NEGATIVE
Moves from joint to joint severely every day.	NEGATIVE
Every joint, from my toes, feet, ankles, knees, shoulders, elbows,wrists, fingers.	NEGATIVE
It seems to be leaving me with nerve damage.	NEGATIVE
Now have numbness below one knee and all fingers in left hand.	NEGATIVE
My right hand has nerves pinching currently and unable to straighten my finger.	NEGATIVE
Also affects my tendons.	NEUTRAL
I also feel it must be more than just arthritis.	NEUTRAL
I am only 50 and feel I will have to get on disability soon if I don't get this under control.	NEGATIVE
What the heck!!!!	NOT_LABELED
Did you ever get a doctors response?	NEUTRAL
Try eliminating sugars / Doing so saved my joints.	POSITIVE
I'm in my 30's and I've had moderate / sever ulcerative colitis for 9 years and about 2 or 3 years after my first symptoms I started experiencing severe joint pain that would migrate from joint to joint (knees, knuckles, shoulders, toes, ankles, inner hip/groin, as well as in my back and chest muscles.	NEGATIVE
The pain would last severely in one joint/area for a 1-4 days often being debilitating (sleepless nights, extreme pain, inability to use joint, sometimes, hot swollen joint) then would travel to another joint usually then travel to the other or go dormant for a time then flair up again.	NEGATIVE
After almost giving up on trying to fix the problem I saw a pattern (a few days after gorging on Halloween candy) that the flairs were directly associated with my consumption of processed sugars.	NEUTRAL
It was amazing after cutting candy, soda, and high fructose corn syrup and other processed sugars out of my diet for about a month the joint pain stopped completely.	POSITIVE
I found can eat natural sugars no problem such as in fruit and juice and have no problem.	POSITIVE
Once again the pain literally stopped after about a month and hasn't returned for now years.	POSITIVE
However, if I stray and start to each too much processed sugars I can feel it creeping in once in full force for a time after straying from my strict no sugar rule).	NEGATIVE
Those little reminders and one large reminder have allowed me to stay ""bad"" sugar free and pain free.	NEUTRAL
Before when I had the pain I used high and low doses of prednizone but even prednizone didn't completely help me.	NEGATIVE
It wasn't until I stopped the sugar and stayed off it that I found relief.	POSITIVE
Also, I've been able to stay predizone free as well).	POSITIVE
Although my colitis is still an issue (mostly managed by Asocal / Asathiaprine) the joint pain is past.	NEUTRAL
I hope this helps and I highly recommend you try this as it saved me so much pain.	POSITIVE
On a related note I also try to stay away from too much fake sugars (diet drinks, etc) as I have found that these have caused me some trouble although not nearly as much as processed sugars.	NEUTRAL
Good luck!!!	NOT_LABELED

Hi everyone, I have had moderate U.C. for 8 years now and I have taken prednisolone tablets (steroids) about 3 times over that timeframe, but generally I control my U.C by using prednisolone enemas which I am doing at the moment.	NEUTRAL
I'm relatively healthy despite needing to go about 4 times a day but I'm never really in remission.	NEUTRAL
Anyway my question is are there any other women experiencing a little bit of HAIR LOSS as I find my hair is thinning around my crown abit, and my part seems to be widening.	NEUTRAL
I am the type of person who is also a worrier and a stresshead at times, so I don't know whether it's to do with that as well.	NEUTRAL
Anyway it would be great if you could let me know.	POSITIVE
Ask for a hormone test.	NEUTRAL
Your hair loss doesn't have to be a part of the UC.	NEUTRAL
In any case patchy hair loss is a symptom that should be looked into.	NEUTRAL
I am a hairdresser and I have noticed that women with UC because of lack of nutrion lose Can have hair loss.	NEUTRAL
You don't absorb enough vitiamns.	NEGATIVE
So you might want to take some.	NEUTRAL
Also it could be hormones like was suggested or it could be a thyroid problem.	NEUTRAL
If you are stressed alot its likely to be that also.	NEUTRAL
When you get stressed your scalp tightens up and it cuts the circulation off to the hair follicals and your hair can get dry and brittle.	NEUTRAL
so stimulation to the scalp helps hair growth and health.	NEUTRAL
You might have some blood work next time you go to the doctor just to rule out all the other stuff mentioned.	NEUTRAL
I am 40 years old and was recently diagnosed with UC (in December).	NEUTRAL
I am taking Lialda and Iron pills.	NEUTRAL
Since the treatments began (and believe me I was stressed prior to then) I am having significant hair loss.	NEGATIVE
I have always had an overabundance of hair, so initially this didn't concern me.	NEUTRAL
However, I have just started to notice what you mention.	NEUTRAL
Widening part, small bald patch at the crown.	NEGATIVE
This does concern me!	NEGATIVE
I think vitamin supplements are worth starting and will do that right away.	NEUTRAL
I have also read articles about lack of iron leading to hair loss - but don't you think my twice daily iron supplement would prevent this?	NEUTRAL
In any case, I would be interested to know if you find something that works and I'll do the same.	NEUTRAL
I have had chronic hair loss in the same pattern(i feel like i have little bald devil horns and im going to need a wig soon!) and have also always had TONS of hair and stress so I did iron/multvitamin and other vitamin regimens for the last 2 years straight,it has not helped my hair one bit.	NEGATIVE
I have tried being on anti-anxiety/anti-depressants to see if the lack of stress would help,1 year on those,no help at all.	NEGATIVE
Now my eyebrows are starting to go rapidly,the entire hair loss thing came on suddenly and like WiLdFiRe!	POSITIVE
Multiple Dr's say they have no clue,a friend suggested I go see a Dermatologist,I don't *think* ive ever done a hormone test or if that'd even provide a solution.I don't want to go bald and then find out what's wrong and then be told it's too late to really grow any of the hair back because of how long it's been happening for.Ya know?	NEUTRAL
I'm so sad because i feel like i resemble a chemotherapy session patient.I can't do my hair anymore because its like paper thing strings.	NEGATIVE

Hi, I was diagnosed with UC over a year ago, and have gone through a plethora of different drugs to find something which works (relatively...), among which Asacol and Prednisone, both of which are having a huge effect on my hair - that is I lose quite a lot.	NEGATIVE
I am quite young (22) so it has nothing to do with hormones etc.	NEUTRAL
My physician told me it was mostly stress (yes, like this is gonna help...anyone with UC knows how stress is hard to control when you're sick and bothered about it!), but my hairdresser aunt actually gave me a great tip - Zinc!	POSITIVE
Generally I find that taking multi-vitamins help me, if only because I know with my bowel habits I don't absorb enough vitamins, but Zinc had a great effect on my hair.	POSITIVE
It is growing again so I am starting to get some thickness back, though I have illusions that it will be back to how it was before.	POSITIVE
Anyway, I took Zinc, 50mg tablets once a day, and in 1 week I felt a difference, and I stopped taking it and the hair still doesn't go off.	POSITIVE
It is worth a try at the very least then!	NEUTRAL
I have uc for 2 years i took the same medication for 45 days only, since then I have thin and dry hair.	NEGATIVE
I have a friend who has a similar problem and wwith the hair loss.	NEUTRAL
She is in her 50's.	NEUTRAL
She recently started drinking an organic supplement called vemma.	NEUTRAL
This has turned her symptoms around and not only is her hair growing back, it is regaining its color.	POSITIVE
She has been completely white headed and it turning back to dark brown, She is thrilled.	POSITIVE
One of the other benefits she is getting, is she has a lot more energy to go with.	POSITIVE
Something to think about.	NEUTRAL
Check out these websites: vmatestimoials.com  vemmatestimonials.com  miracles of mangosteen and minerals.com   my email ***@**** This is about wellness and prevention.	NEUTRAL
hi, my daughter is suffering from ulcerative colitis ,she is only 7 yrs old ,and for the last 1 year she is taking prednisolone .	NEUTRAL
I want to know is this hair loss is due to excessive medicine intake or due to some other reasons ?	NEUTRAL
I've had UC for 2 years and it's been pretty much under control the past 6 months.	POSITIVE
I was first placed on Asacol, that and drugs in the same category do cause hair loss.	NEGATIVE
Switched to Sulfasalazine and the hair loss stopped, but in the last couple months started losing hair again and have a bald patch on the back of my head.	NEGATIVE
I'm 25 and this is NOT a side effect of sulfasalazine, so I guess this is just what many uc sufferers have to deal with.	NEUTRAL
made a dr. appt just in case though.	NEUTRAL
So sorry for eveyone's troubles, wish you all the best.	NEUTRAL
Hair loss is a side effect from Mesalamine, which is an NSAID (non-steroid anti inflammatory).	NEGATIVE
Treatment with NSAID's creates a shock to your system which transforms hairs in the growing stage to the dormant stage (for a few months) and then the shedding stage.	NEUTRAL
This is why you don't see the shedding until a few months in.	NEUTRAL
The damage is done when the hair is rendered dormant, but the shedding that follows takes a few months.	NEUTRAL
Do some research on NSAID's and hair loss.	NEUTRAL
I am a 31-year-old woman who has had U.C. for three years.	NEUTRAL
I was taking my regular (doctor recommended) vitamins: fish oil, calcium, vitamin D, vitamin C, magnesium; and stopped taking them because I was tired of taking so many pills every day, along with Asacol.	NEGATIVE
Soon I developed severe pneumonia, was in the hospital for two weeks, had lots of chest x-rays, and my hair began just dropping out.	NEGATIVE
Then the remaining hairs were quite thin and showed a piment-less stripe all around.	NEGATIVE
The stripe makes it easy to see how far my hair has grown in a year -- 3.5”, compared to the normal 6”.	NEGATIVE
As soon as I went back on my vitamins, the hair loss desisted and the lost hairs began growing back right away.	POSITIVE
In other words, take vitamins!	NEUTRAL
And if your U.C. is still not under control, ask your doctor about stepping up your treatment to a medication like Imuran (Azathioprine), an immunosuppressant, and go to a bowel disease specialist.	NEUTRAL
Taking these steps has turned my life around – I feel better than I have in three years!	POSITIVE
Just don’t skip doses.	NEUTRAL
Do you know if the hair loss just a temporaray side effect from the mesalamine?	NEUTRAL
I'm taking it(Lialda) and noticed my hair really shedding now the past week or two.	NEGATIVE
I've been on the Lialda for about 4 months.	NEUTRAL
I hope it's not permanent.	NEUTRAL
I would suggest assisting your circulation with L-argimine and ginkgo biloba.	NEUTRAL
I have Celiac disease, so I also have absorptive problems.	NEGATIVE
I take lots of vitamins and minerals and eat gluten-free and eat healthy.	NEUTRAL
But adding these two aids to circulation has me looking great (skin).	POSITIVE
So between those and adding a shower water filter to take out both chlorine and chloramine that my city adds to the water, my skin and hair are optimized.	POSITIVE
My hair looks healthy and fuller, although it's only been a few weeks.	POSITIVE
Lialda nd any other type of mesalamine do not cause hair loss.	POSITIVE
Steroids and malnutrition do.	NEGATIVE
Yes, Mesalamine, Lialda, Asacol etc., do not correlate with hair loss.	POSITIVE
Prednisone, Cortisone, etc. and stress do.	NEUTRAL
It can be either and at 7, I would ask a doctor.	NEUTRAL
Take vitamins.	NEUTRAL
It was only a matter of time and not your medicine.	NEUTRAL
Has anyone experienced hair loss with using 6mp for UC.	NEUTRAL
I've been on it for 2 months and noticed hair loss in the last three weeks.	NEGATIVE
Does this ever stop?	NEUTRAL
